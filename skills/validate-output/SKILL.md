# /dm:validate-output

## Purpose

Validate marketing content against expected structural schemas to ensure completeness, formatting consistency, and production-readiness. Checks required sections, word count ranges, markdown formatting compliance, placeholder text detection (unfilled template variables, lorem ipsum, TBD markers), and content-CTA consistency. Supports eight built-in schemas for common marketing content types plus custom schemas for brand-specific templates.

This command catches the structural and formatting issues that quality evaluation misses — the missing H2 that breaks SEO, the placeholder "[INSERT COMPANY NAME]" that slipped through, the blog post that is 300 words short of the brief requirement, or the email that has a CTA promising a demo but the body talks about a whitepaper. It is designed to be run as a final pre-publication check after content quality has been evaluated via /dm:eval-content.

## Input Required

The user must provide (or will be prompted for):

- **Content to validate**: The text to check — provided inline, as a pasted block, or as a file path. Supports any marketing content format
- **Schema name or file** (optional): One of the eight built-in schemas — `blog_post`, `email`, `ad_copy`, `social_post`, `landing_page`, `press_release`, `content_brief`, `campaign_plan` — or a file path to a custom JSON schema. If omitted, the validator auto-detects the most likely schema based on content structure, length, and formatting patterns. Custom schemas follow the format defined in `skills/context-engine/eval-framework-guide.md`

## Process

1. **Load brand context**: Read `~/.claude-marketing/brands/_active-brand.json` for the active slug, then load `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`. Apply brand formatting standards and content requirements. Also check for guidelines at `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/guidelines/_manifest.json` — if present, load template definitions from `templates/` that may define brand-specific required sections, word count ranges, and formatting rules. Check for custom schemas at `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/schemas/`. Check for agency SOPs at `~/.claude-marketing/sops/`. If no brand exists, ask: "Set up a brand first (/dm:brand-setup)?" — or proceed with defaults.
2. **Determine schema**: If a schema name or file was provided, use it directly. If not, execute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/output-validator.py --brand {slug} --action detect-schema --content "{content}"` to auto-detect the most appropriate schema based on content characteristics. Report which schema was selected and why, so the user can override if the auto-detection was wrong.
3. **Run structural validation**: Execute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/output-validator.py --brand {slug} --action validate --content "{content}" --schema {schema_name_or_path}`. The validator checks:
   - **Required sections**: All sections defined in the schema are present with appropriate headings. For each missing section, identify what is expected and where it should appear in the content structure
   - **Word count**: Total word count and per-section word counts fall within the schema-defined ranges. Flag both under-count (too thin, lacking depth) and over-count (too long, needs trimming)
   - **Formatting compliance**: Markdown heading hierarchy is correct (no skipped levels), lists are properly formatted, links are valid syntax, images have alt text, code blocks are closed, and tables render correctly
   - **Placeholder detection**: Scan for unfilled template variables (`{placeholder}`, `[PLACEHOLDER]`, `[INSERT X]`, `TODO`, `TBD`, `FIXME`, `Lorem ipsum`, `xxx`, `ACME Corp` used as placeholder), partial completions, and obviously templated content that was not customized
   - **CTA consistency**: The call-to-action matches the content's topic and promise — a blog post about email marketing should not CTA to a social media guide, an email promoting a webinar should link to the webinar registration, not a generic contact page
   - **SEO structure** (for blog_post and landing_page schemas): H1 present and singular, meta description length within 150-160 characters, title tag within 50-60 characters, internal link present, keyword appears in H1 and first 100 words
   - **Compliance markers** (for regulated industries): Required disclaimers present, mandatory disclosures included, terms and conditions referenced where needed
4. **Generate fix guidance**: For each failed check, provide specific guidance:
   - What is missing or incorrect, with the exact location in the content
   - What the schema requires (the rule being enforced)
   - How to fix it, with an example of what the corrected section should look like
   - Whether the fix is required (schema mandates it) or recommended (best practice)
5. **Handle custom schema requests**: If the user needs a schema that does not match any built-in option, guide them on the JSON schema format:
   - Required fields: `name`, `sections` (array of section definitions with name, required flag, min/max word count), `total_word_count` (min/max), `formatting_rules`, `placeholder_patterns`
   - Offer to generate a starter schema based on the content's current structure that the user can refine
6. **Present checklist-style results**: Format all validation results as a pass/fail checklist that the user can work through sequentially, with the most critical failures first.

## Output

A structured validation report containing:

- **Validation score**: Percentage of checks passed out of total checks run — the headline metric for structural completeness
- **Schema used**: Which schema was applied (built-in name or custom file path), whether it was user-specified or auto-detected, and the detection confidence if auto-detected
- **Pass/fail checklist**: Each check as a line item with pass or fail status:
  - **Sections check**: List of required sections with present/missing status. For each missing section, the expected heading, where it should appear, and an example of what it should contain
  - **Word count check**: Total word count versus schema range, plus per-section counts for any sections outside their expected range. Shows the delta (e.g., "247 words short of the 1,500 minimum")
  - **Formatting check**: Heading hierarchy validation, list formatting, link syntax, image alt text, code block closure, table rendering. Each issue with its location and the specific formatting rule violated
  - **Placeholder check**: Every detected placeholder instance with the exact text, line location, and suggested action (replace with real content, remove, or confirm if intentional). Grouped by type: template variables, lorem ipsum, TBD/TODO markers, obvious placeholder names
  - **CTA consistency check**: Whether the CTA aligns with the content topic and promise. If misaligned, the specific inconsistency and a suggested correction
  - **SEO structure check** (if applicable): H1 presence and uniqueness, meta description length, title tag length, keyword placement, internal linking
  - **Compliance check** (if applicable): Required disclaimers, disclosures, and legal references
- **Fix checklist**: Priority-ordered list of all failures with specific fix instructions — required fixes first, then recommended improvements, each with example corrected text
- **Placeholder inventory**: Complete list of all detected placeholders across the content, deduplicated, so the user has a single reference for everything that needs to be filled in
- **Schema reference**: If the user may need it, a summary of the schema rules that were applied — useful for writers to understand the structural requirements before starting their next piece

## Agents Used
