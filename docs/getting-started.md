## 1. Prerequisites

You need exactly one thing to get started:

- **Claude Code** installed and working on your machine (macOS, Windows, or Linux), **or**
- **Claude Cowork** (part of Claude Desktop on macOS and Windows --- requires Claude Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)

That is it. Everything else is optional.

**Optional but nice to have:**

- **Python 3.8 or newer** --- unlocks advanced scoring features like brand voice analysis and content readability. The plugin works perfectly without Python; you just get bonus capabilities if it is installed.
- **No API keys required** --- the plugin ships with 143 reference knowledge files that power all 16 marketing modules. The optional MCP integrations (14 HTTP connectors that work in Cowork, plus 67 npx integrations for Claude Code) use your own account credentials and can be configured later. Run `/dm:integrations` to see which connectors are available and `/dm:connect <name>` for step-by-step setup.

> **Bottom line:** If you can run Claude Code or Claude Cowork, you can use this plugin right now.

---

## 2. Installation

You have three options depending on which Claude interface you use.

### Option A: Install in Claude Code (from a local directory)

If you have the plugin files on your machine (downloaded or cloned):

```
claude plugin add /path/to/digital-marketing-pro
```

On Windows, that might look like:

```
claude plugin add "C:\Users\yourname\Downloads\digital-marketing-pro"
```

### Option B: Install in Claude Code (from the plugin registry)

If the plugin has been published to the Claude plugin registry:

```
claude plugin add digital-marketing-pro
```

### Option C: Install in Claude Cowork

If you use Claude Cowork (the agentic mode in Claude Desktop):

1. Compress the `digital-marketing-pro/` folder into a ZIP file
2. Open Cowork in Claude Desktop
3. Click **Plugin** in the left sidebar
4. Click **+** then **Upload**
5. Select your ZIP file

Or browse the [Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins) directly from Cowork: click **Plugin** → **+** → **Browse plugins** → search for "Digital Marketing Pro."

> **Cowork note:** After installing, Cowork will ask for permission to access `~/.claude-marketing/` when it first tries to read or write brand data. Grant this permission --- it is where your brand profiles and campaign history are stored.

For full details on Cowork capabilities (document creation, visual review, app integration), see the [Claude Interfaces Guide](claude-interfaces.md#claude-cowork-full-support).

### What successful installation looks like

After running either command, you should see output similar to this:

```
Installing plugin: digital-marketing-pro v2.5.0
  - 16 marketing modules loaded
  - 118 slash commands registered (/dm:*)
  - 25 specialist agents available
  - 14 HTTP connectors + 67 npx integrations configured
  - 3 event hooks configured (SessionStart, PreToolUse, SessionEnd)

Plugin "digital-marketing-pro" installed successfully.
Run /dm:brand-setup to create your first brand profile.
```

If you see an error instead, verify that your Claude Code installation is up to date and that the path to the plugin directory is correct.

---

## 3. First Run --- What Happens

The moment you start a new session in Claude Code or Cowork after installing the plugin, a few things happen automatically behind the scenes. You do not need to do anything --- this is just so you understand what is going on.

### The startup sequence

1. **SessionStart hook fires** --- the plugin's event system detects that a new session has begun.

2. **The setup script runs** --- it checks for dependencies and looks for your active brand profile (`setup.py --check-deps --summary`).

3. **You see a status banner** --- the output depends on whether you have a brand profile set up yet.

### If you have not set up a brand yet

You will see this:

```
=== DIGITAL MARKETING PRO ===
No active brand. Run /dm:brand-setup to create one.
===
```

This is your cue to create your first brand profile (covered in the next section).

### If you already have an active brand

You will see a 15-line brand summary that looks something like this:

```
=== DIGITAL MARKETING PRO ===
Brand: Greenfield Coffee Roasters (greenfield-coffee-roasters)
Industry: Food & Beverage (regulated: no)
Model: B2C_DTC | Revenue: transactional
Voice: Formality 4/10 | Energy 7/10 | Humor 4/10 | Authority 6/10
Traits: warm, knowledgeable, passionate
Channels: email (primary), instagram
Markets: US | Compliance: FTC, CAN-SPAM
Goals: Grow subscriber list by 40% in Q2
Competitors: Blue Bottle, Counter Culture, Stumptown
Active campaigns: 2 | Tracked insights: 14
Python: lite (nltk, textstat)
MCP: Google Analytics, Mailchimp connected
===
```

This summary is not just for you to read --- it is injected directly into the session context so that every marketing response from that point forward is grounded in your brand's voice, industry, compliance requirements, and strategic goals.

---

## 4. Your First Brand Profile

Let us walk through setting up a brand from scratch. For this example, we will create a profile for **Greenfield Coffee Roasters**, a direct-to-consumer specialty coffee brand.

### Starting brand setup

Type the following in your Claude Code or Cowork session:

```
/dm:brand-setup
```

The plugin will walk you through an interactive profiling conversation. By default, it uses **Quick Setup** mode, which asks just 5 essential questions.

### Quick Setup walkthrough

Here is what the conversation looks like:

```
You: /dm:brand-setup

Plugin: I'll help you set up your brand profile. Let's start with the essentials.

         Quick Setup (5 questions)
         -------------------------

         1. What's your brand or business name?
You:     Greenfield Coffee Roasters

         2. In one sentence, what does Greenfield Coffee Roasters do?
You:     We roast and sell single-origin specialty coffee direct to consumers online

         3. Who is your primary customer?
You:     Coffee enthusiasts aged 25-45 who care about sourcing and sustainability

         4. Pick 3 words that describe how your brand communicates:
You:     Warm, knowledgeable, passionate

         5. Where do you primarily market? (social media, email, SEO, paid ads, etc.)
You:     Email and Instagram
```

### What happens behind the scenes

From those 5 answers, the plugin intelligently builds a complete brand profile:

- **Industry** detected as Food & Beverage based on your description
- **Business model** identified as B2C DTC (direct to consumer, transactional revenue)
- **Compliance rules** loaded for FTC endorsement guidelines and CAN-SPAM (email marketing)
- **Voice dimensions** mapped from your 3 words:
  - "Warm" translates to Formality 4/10, Humor 4/10
  - "Knowledgeable" translates to Authority 6/10
  - "Passionate" translates to Energy 7/10
- **Channel specs** loaded for email (subject line limits, preview text guidelines) and Instagram (caption lengths, hashtag best practices)
- **Sensible defaults** set for everything else (you can refine later)

### The confirmation

After processing, you see your brand summary:

```
Brand profile created!

Brand: Greenfield Coffee Roasters (greenfield-coffee-roasters)
Industry: Food & Beverage (regulated: no)
Model: B2C_DTC | Revenue: transactional
Voice: Formality 4/10 | Energy 7/10 | Humor 4/10 | Authority 6/10
Traits: warm, knowledgeable, passionate
Channels: email (primary), instagram
Markets: US | Compliance: FTC, CAN-SPAM
Saved to: ~/.claude-marketing/brands/greenfield-coffee-roasters/profile.json

Quick profile created! You can refine it anytime with /dm:brand-setup --full
```

### Where your profile lives

Your brand data is stored locally on your machine at:

```
~/.claude-marketing/brands/greenfield-coffee-roasters/profile.json
```

This is a persistent location outside the plugin directory, so your brand profiles survive plugin updates.

### Want more detail? Use Full Setup

The Quick Setup is great for getting started fast, but if you want a more thorough profile, run:

```
/dm:brand-setup --full
```

Full Setup asks 17 questions across 6 categories:

| Category             | Questions | What it captures                                        |
|----------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Brand Identity       | 4         | Name, elevator pitch, USP, mission and values           |
| Business Model       | 3         | Business type, revenue model, price range, sales cycle  |
| Industry & Compliance| 3         | Industry, regulated status, target markets              |
| Brand Voice          | 4         | Voice dimensions (1-10 scales), personality traits, this-not-that examples, sample content |
| Channels & Goals     | 2         | Active channels, primary goal, KPIs, budget, team size  |
| Competitors          | 1         | 3-5 competitors with strengths and weaknesses           |

You can also run Full Setup later to fill in sections you skipped. It will preserve your existing answers and only ask about what is missing.

---

## 5. Importing Your Brand Guidelines (Optional)

If your brand has a style guide, messaging framework, restriction list, or channel-specific rules, you can import them now. Guidelines go beyond the numeric voice scores in your brand profile — they capture the detailed rules that make content authentically on-brand.

```
/dm:import-guidelines
```

You can paste content from existing documents or describe rules conversationally:

```
You: Here's our brand voice guide: We're friendly but professional.
     Never use jargon. Always explain technical concepts simply.
     Sentences should be under 20 words.
```

The plugin extracts the rules, structures them into the right category, and saves them. They are then enforced automatically when creating content.

**What you can import:**
- **Voice & tone rules** — writing style, dos/don'ts, readability rules
- **Restrictions** — banned words, restricted claims, mandatory disclaimers
- **Channel styles** — per-channel tone and format rules (LinkedIn vs. Instagram vs. email)
- **Messaging frameworks** — approved key messages, taglines, positioning
- **Deliverable templates** — custom formats for reports, proposals, briefs (`/dm:import-template`)
- **Agency SOPs** — approval workflows, launch checklists, escalation procedures (`/dm:import-sop`)

Guidelines persist across sessions — import once, enforced every time. You can always add more later.

> See `docs/brand-guidelines.md` for the full guide with worked examples and all guideline categories.

---

## 6. Your First Marketing Task

Now that your brand profile is set up, try asking for some real marketing deliverables. You do not need to use any special commands --- just describe what you need in plain language.

### Example: Writing a welcome email sequence

```
You: Write a 3-email welcome sequence for new subscribers
```

Here is what happens behind the scenes when you make this request:

1. **Content Engine activates** --- the plugin recognizes this as an email marketing task
2. **Brand voice loads** --- your "warm, knowledgeable, passionate" voice profile shapes every word
3. **Compliance rules applied** --- CAN-SPAM requirements (unsubscribe link, physical address) are factored in
4. **Platform specs loaded** --- email best practices are applied (subject line under 40 characters for mobile, preview text 40-90 characters)

### What you receive

The plugin delivers a complete 3-email sequence, each with:

- **Subject line** (optimized for mobile preview length)
- **Preview text** (the snippet visible in inbox before opening)
- **Body copy** (written in your brand voice, structured for scannability)
- **Call to action** (clear, single CTA per email)

For Greenfield Coffee Roasters, the sequence would follow this arc:

| Email | Timing      | Theme                          | Voice emphasis  |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1     | Immediate   | Welcome + brand story          | Warm            |
| 2     | Day 3       | Brewing guide + product rec    | Knowledgeable   |
| 3     | Day 7       | First purchase offer           | Passionate      |

- **Email 1** tells the Greenfield origin story, emphasizing sustainable sourcing and the people behind the beans. Tone is welcoming, like a friend inviting you into their world.
- **Email 2** shares a practical brewing guide (pour-over, French press, or AeroPress) and recommends a specific single-origin coffee to try. Tone is authoritative but approachable, sharing expertise without being preachy.
- **Email 3** extends a first-purchase offer with language that conveys genuine enthusiasm for quality. Tone is energetic and direct, with a clear CTA to shop.

### Other things to try

Here are a few more requests that work well as a first task:

- "Create a content calendar for next month" --- activates the Content Engine with your channels and content pillars
- "Audit my competitor Blue Bottle Coffee" --- activates Competitive Intelligence with industry benchmarks
- "Write Instagram captions for our new Ethiopian single-origin" --- activates Content Engine with Instagram platform specs
- "Build a buyer persona for our ideal customer" --- activates Audience Intelligence with your existing audience data
- "Plan a product launch for our new cold brew line" --- activates Campaign Orchestrator with your channels and budget context

Every response is automatically shaped by your brand profile. You never have to remind the plugin about your voice, audience, or compliance requirements.

### SEO Execution

Use `/dm:seo-implement` to update meta tags, deploy schema, and create redirects directly on WordPress or Webflow. `/dm:rank-monitor` sets up ongoing keyword tracking. `/dm:serp-tracker` monitors SERP features including AI Overviews.

### Competitor Monitoring

Use `/dm:competitor-monitor` to set up ongoing competitive scanning. `/dm:share-of-voice` calculates your visibility vs competitors. `/dm:competitor-alerts` configures notifications for competitive changes.

### Revenue Simulation

Use `/dm:simulate` to model revenue impact of budget changes with Monte Carlo simulation. `/dm:what-if` for quick scenario comparisons. `/dm:churn-risk` to score customer segments for churn probability.

### GEO Monitoring

Use `/dm:geo-monitor` to track brand visibility across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and AI Overviews. `/dm:entity-audit` checks entity consistency across Wikidata, Knowledge Panel, and directories. `/dm:narrative-tracker` monitors what AI says about your brand.

### Creative Intelligence

Use `/dm:creative-health` for creative fatigue prediction across active ads. `/dm:content-decay-scan` finds decaying content and prioritizes refreshes by revenue impact.

### Synthetic Audiences

Use `/dm:focus-group` to run simulated focus groups from CRM data. `/dm:message-test` to pre-test messaging variants. `/dm:pricing-test` for price sensitivity analysis.

---

## Evaluation & Quality Assurance

### Quick Start
1. **Evaluate any content**: `/dm:eval-content` — runs the full 6-dimension eval suite
2. **Check for hallucinations**: Automatic — the Write|Edit hook scans content in real-time
3. **Verify claims**: `/dm:verify-claims` with an evidence file for claims-heavy content
4. **Track quality over time**: `/dm:quality-report` for trends and regression alerts
5. **Configure thresholds**: `/dm:eval-config` to set brand-specific quality standards

### Evidence Files
For claim verification, create a JSON evidence file:
```json
{
  "evidence": [
    {"claim": "50% increase in conversions", "source": "GA4 Q4 report", "date": "2025-12-31", "verified": true}
  ]
}
```

### Eval Grades
A+ (95-100) through F (<40). Content below the auto-reject threshold (default 40) is blocked from the approval workflow.

---

## Multilingual Support

### Quick Start
1. **Configure languages**: `/dm:language-config` — set primary language, do-not-translate terms
2. **Translate content**: `/dm:translate-content` — auto-routes to best translation service
3. **Score translations**: `/dm:multilingual-score` — check quality before publishing
4. **Localize campaigns**: `/dm:localize-campaign` — adapt entire campaigns for target markets
5. **Audit hreflang**: `/dm:hreflang-check` — verify multilingual SEO implementation

### Translation Services Setup
Set environment variables for the services you want to use:
- **DeepL**: `DEEPL_API_KEY` — best for European and CJK languages
- **Sarvam AI**: `SARVAM_API_KEY` — specialist for 22 Indian languages
- **Google Cloud Translation**: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` — broadest coverage (100+ languages)
- **Lara Translate**: `LARA_API_KEY` — marketing-context translation with translation memories

### Language Configuration
Run `/dm:language-config` to set:
- Primary content language
- Target languages for translation
- Do-not-translate terms (brand names, product names)
- Translation service preferences per language

---

## 7. Understanding the Session Lifecycle

Digital Marketing Pro operates across three phases in every Claude Code or Cowork session. Understanding this lifecycle helps you get the most out of the plugin.

### Phase 1: Session Start

**What happens:** The SessionStart hook fires and loads your active brand context into the session.

**What this means for you:** From the very first message you type, Claude already knows your brand name, voice settings, industry, compliance requirements, target audience, active channels, competitors, and current goals. You never have to re-explain who you are or what your brand sounds like.

**What you see:** The 15-line brand summary banner printed at the top of your session.

### Phase 2: During Your Session

**What happens:** As you make requests, the appropriate marketing modules activate automatically. Three things are applied to every piece of marketing output:

- **Brand voice** --- content matches your formality, energy, humor, and authority settings
- **Compliance rules** --- outputs respect regulations for your industry and target markets (GDPR, FTC, HIPAA, and others)
- **Industry benchmarks** --- recommendations are calibrated to realistic performance standards for your sector

**The PreToolUse hook:** When the plugin writes content to a file, the PreToolUse hook can check it for brand alignment and compliance before saving. This acts as a guardrail to catch anything that drifts off-brand.

**What you see:** Marketing deliverables that sound like they came from someone who has worked with your brand for months, not minutes.

### Phase 3: Session End

**What happens:** The SessionEnd hook fires and saves key marketing insights from the session to your brand profile. This includes things like:

- New audience insights discovered during persona research
- Competitor intelligence gathered during analysis
- Campaign decisions and strategic direction
- Content performance hypotheses

**What this means for you:** The next time you start a session, those insights are already part of your brand context. The plugin gets smarter about your brand over time, building a growing body of institutional marketing knowledge.

**What you see:** A brief confirmation that insights have been saved.

### The lifecycle in one diagram

```
Session Start              During Session             Session End
     |                          |                          |
     v                          v                          v
Brand context            Modules activate           Insights saved
auto-loaded         Voice + Compliance + Benchmarks    to brand profile
     |               applied to all outputs              |
     v                          |                        v
15-line summary          You work normally         Ready for next
printed                  (just ask for things)        session
```

---

## 8. Python Dependencies (Optional)

Digital Marketing Pro is designed to work at full capability without Python. All 16 marketing modules, 25 specialist agents, and 118 slash commands function using the plugin's built-in reference knowledge. Python adds bonus scoring and automation features.

### Three dependency modes

| Mode               | Install size | What it adds                                                       |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Knowledge-only** | 0 MB         | All modules, agents, and commands. No Python needed.               |
| **Lite**           | ~15 MB       | Brand voice scoring, content quality scoring, readability analysis  |
| **Full**           | ~50 MB       | Competitor scraping, QR code generation, AI visibility checking     |

### Knowledge-only (default)

This is what you get out of the box. No setup required.

You have access to:
- All 16 marketing modules with 143 reference knowledge files
- All 115 `/dm:` slash commands
- All 25 specialist agents
- Brand profiling, session hooks, and campaign tracking
- Industry benchmarks, compliance rules, and platform specifications

The plugin will tell you when a Python-dependent feature is unavailable and will gracefully skip it rather than throwing an error.

### Lite mode

If you want brand voice scoring and content readability analysis, install two small packages:

```
pip install nltk textstat
```

This unlocks:
- **Brand voice scoring** --- quantitative alignment score (0-100) measuring how well content matches your voice profile
- **Content quality scoring** --- readability grade level, sentence complexity, and vocabulary analysis
- **Readability analysis** --- Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, and other standard readability metrics

### Full mode

For the complete feature set, install all dependencies:

```
pip install -r /path/to/digital-marketing-pro/scripts/requirements.txt
```

This adds everything in Lite mode, plus:
- **Competitor scraping** --- automated extraction of competitor page titles, meta descriptions, and content structure
- **QR code generation** --- create QR codes for UTM-tagged URLs (useful for print-to-digital campaigns)
- **AI visibility checking** --- programmatic checks of how your brand appears in AI answer engines (requires OpenAI or Anthropic API key in `.env`)

### How to check your current mode

The brand summary banner shown at session start includes a Python status line:

```
Python: not installed          (knowledge-only mode)
Python: lite (nltk, textstat)  (lite mode)
Python: full (all deps)        (full mode)
```

## 9. Connector Discovery (New in v2.4.0)

Digital Marketing Pro v2.4.0 introduces a connector discovery system that makes it easy to see which external platforms are connected and set up new ones.

### Checking your connector status

```
/dm:integrations
```

This shows a dashboard grouped by category (chat, design, CRM, SEO, advertising, analytics, and more) with each connector marked as **connected** or **available**. It also shows which skills gain capabilities from each connector.

Example output:

```
=== CONNECTOR STATUS ===

 Chat                           Connected
  slack                         ✅ HTTP
  intercom                      ○ npx (needs INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN)

 Design                         Connected
  canva                         ✅ HTTP
  figma                         ✅ HTTP

 CRM                            Partial
  hubspot                       ✅ HTTP
  salesforce                    ○ npx (needs SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL, SALESFORCE_ACCESS_TOKEN)
  pipedrive                     ○ npx (needs PIPEDRIVE_API_TOKEN)

 ...

Connected: 14 HTTP | Available: 33 npx
Skills fully unlocked: 87/117 | Skills with enhanced capabilities: 117/117
```

### Setting up a new connector

```
/dm:connect slack
```

For HTTP connectors (like Slack, Canva, HubSpot), you get OAuth-based setup instructions that work in both Cowork and Claude Code. For npx connectors (like Salesforce, Google Ads), you get step-by-step credential setup instructions.

### Platform-level integrations

Some integrations (like Google Drive and Google Sheets) may be connected at the Claude platform level rather than through MCP. These platform-level integrations are managed in Claude Desktop settings and work automatically in Cowork sessions. The plugin can use these integrations even if they do not appear in the connector status dashboard.

To check platform-level integrations: Open Claude Desktop → Settings → Integrations.

### Tip: You do not always need slash commands

Slash commands are useful for structured, templated outputs. But you can also just describe what you need in natural language:

```
"Help me write ad copy for our new cold brew"
"What should our content strategy look like for Q3?"
"I need to respond to negative reviews on Google"
```

The plugin's 16 modules will activate based on the intent of your request, whether or not you use a slash command. The 115 commands simply give you a direct shortcut to a specific workflow.
