# Citation Management — Building, Auditing & Maintaining Local Citations

> Citations are online mentions of a business's Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP). They are a top-5 local pack ranking factor. Businesses in the top 3 local pack positions have an average of 85 citations on unique domains. Accuracy matters more than volume — a single inconsistent citation can suppress rankings.

---

## What Citations Are and Why They Matter

A local citation is any online mention of a business's core identifying information: Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP). Citations appear in two forms:

### Structured Citations
Directory listings with standardized data fields (name, address, phone, website, hours, categories). These appear on platforms like Yelp, Yellow Pages, BBB, and industry-specific directories.

### Unstructured Citations
Mentions of the business NAP within articles, blog posts, press releases, social profiles, event pages, or any other non-directory web page. These are harder to build intentionally but carry strong trust signals because they occur naturally.

### How Citations Affect Rankings

Google uses citations as a trust and verification mechanism. When Google finds the same NAP data confirmed across many independent sources, it increases confidence that the business is legitimate, located where it claims, and actively operating. Specifically:

- **Citation volume**: More citations on authoritative, relevant sources correlate with higher local pack positions
- **Citation accuracy**: NAP consistency across all citations is a ranking signal. Inconsistencies create confusion for Google and suppress rankings
- **Citation quality**: A citation on a high-authority domain (Yelp, BBB, Chamber of Commerce) carries more weight than one on a low-quality directory
- **Citation relevance**: Industry-specific citations signal niche relevance (Healthgrades for healthcare, Avvo for legal, OpenTable for restaurants)

## NAP Consistency Requirements

NAP consistency means the business name, address, and phone number appear identically everywhere on the web. Even minor formatting variations can count as inconsistencies.

### The Canonical NAP

Before building any citations, establish the canonical NAP — the single, exact version of the name, address, and phone that will be used everywhere.

| Element | Consistency Rules | Example |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Business Name | Exact legal name. No abbreviations, no extra keywords, no DBA variations unless that is the public-facing name | "Johnson & Associates Law Firm" not "Johnson and Associates" or "Johnson Law" |
| Street Address | Choose one format and never deviate. Suite vs Ste vs #. Street vs St. Avenue vs Ave. | "123 Main Street, Suite 200" everywhere — not "123 Main St., Ste 200" on some listings |
| City, State, ZIP | Full state or abbreviation — pick one. Include ZIP+4 or not — pick one | "Chicago, IL 60601" everywhere — not "Chicago, Illinois 60601" on some |
| Phone Number | One primary number with consistent formatting. Local number preferred over toll-free | "(312) 555-1234" everywhere — not "312-555-1234" or "3125551234" on some |

### Common Inconsistency Sources

- Former business name still appearing on old listings
- Previous address persisting after a move
- Multiple phone numbers in use (main line, tracking numbers, mobile)
- Franchisees using corporate name instead of location-specific name
- Data aggregators propagating outdated information to downstream directories

## Data Aggregators

Data aggregators are wholesale data providers that feed business information to hundreds of downstream directories, apps, and mapping services. Incorrect data at the aggregator level propagates errors everywhere.

### The Major Aggregators

| Aggregator | Downstream Impact | Submission Method |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Data Axle (formerly Infogroup) | Powers YP.com, Superpages, CitySearch, and 100+ directories | Express Update (free) or direct submission |
| Neustar Localeze | Powers Bing, Apple Maps, Yahoo, and 50+ directories | Localeze portal (paid) or through management platforms |
| Foursquare | Powers Apple Maps, Uber, Snapchat, Twitter/X, and many apps | Claim on Foursquare business portal (free) |

### Aggregator Strategy

1. **Submit to all three aggregators first** — Before building individual citations, ensure data aggregators have the correct canonical NAP. This prevents them from propagating incorrect data downstream
2. **Wait 4-8 weeks** — Aggregator data takes time to propagate to downstream directories. Check propagation status before manually submitting to directories that are fed by aggregators
3. **Monitor quarterly** — Re-check aggregator accuracy every 90 days. Third-party data corrections, user edits, and automated processes can introduce errors over time
4. **After address or name changes** — Update all three aggregators immediately. Then manually update Tier 1 citations. Then wait for downstream propagation and clean up residual errors

---

## Citation Audit Methodology

### Step 1: Establish the Canonical NAP
Document the exact, character-for-character business name, address, and phone number. This is the baseline against which all citations will be measured.

### Step 2: Crawl Existing Citations
Use citation scanning tools to identify current listings:

| Tool | Type | Coverage |
|------|------|----------|
| BrightLocal Citation Tracker | Paid | 1,000+ sources |
| Whitespark Local Citation Finder | Paid | 300+ sources |
| Moz Local Check | Free (basic) | Top 40 sources |
| Yext Scan | Free (basic) | 200+ sources (locks you into Yext for management) |
| Manual Google Search | Free | Search `"business name" "phone number"` and `"street address"` |

### Step 3: Score Each Citation

| Score | Meaning | Action Required |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Exact Match | NAP matches canonical exactly | No action — maintain |
| Minor Variation | Formatting difference (St vs Street, missing suite number) | Update to exact match |
| Major Discrepancy | Wrong name, old address, wrong phone | Update or remove immediately |
| Duplicate Listing | Two listings on the same platform for the same location | Merge or remove duplicate |
| Missing Citation | No listing exists on a relevant platform | Create new listing |

### Step 4: Prioritize Remediation
1. Fix major discrepancies on Tier 1 sources first
2. Correct data aggregator errors (these cascade downstream)
3. Resolve duplicate listings on all platforms
4. Fix minor variations on Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources
5. Build missing citations in priority order

### Step 5: Ongoing Monitoring
- Re-audit quarterly (minimum) or after any NAP change
- Set Google Alerts for the business name to catch new unstructured citations
- Monitor data aggregator accuracy every 90 days
- Check for user-suggested edits on GBP and other platforms that allow public edits

## Citation Building Strategy

### Prioritization Framework

Build citations in this order for maximum impact:

1. **Data aggregators** (Week 1) — Data Axle, Neustar Localeze, Foursquare
2. **Tier 1 general directories** (Week 1-2) — Google, Apple, Bing, Yelp, Facebook, YP, BBB
3. **Industry-specific directories** (Week 2-4) — Top 5-10 directories for your specific industry
4. **Tier 2 general directories** (Month 2) — Manta, Hotfrog, Cylex, EZLocal, etc.
5. **Local directories** (Month 2-3) — City-specific directories, local newspaper directories, local chamber of commerce
6. **Niche and long-tail directories** (Month 3+) — Smaller directories relevant to your business

### Submission Best Practices

- Always use the canonical NAP — copy-paste to prevent typos
- Add the same business description (or a close variant) to every listing — consistency signals legitimacy
- Upload photos to every platform that supports them — listings with photos get more engagement and look more legitimate
- Select categories consistently across platforms — use the closest match to your GBP primary category
- Claim and verify listings wherever possible — claimed listings can be edited later; unclaimed ones cannot
- Track submissions in a spreadsheet: platform name, URL, submission date, live date, login credentials

### Citation Velocity

- **Do not build 100 citations in one day** — Sudden citation spikes look unnatural to Google
- **Target pace**: 5-10 new citations per week for the first month, then 3-5 per week ongoing
- **Consistency matters more than speed** — A steady build over 3 months outperforms a one-time citation blast
- **Stop building when returns diminish** — Beyond 80-100 quality citations, additional low-authority directories have negligible impact

---

## Cleaning Up Incorrect Citations

### Claimed Listings
Log in and edit directly. Most platforms allow the business owner to update NAP at any time.

### Unclaimed Listings
1. Claim the listing (usually requires verification by phone, postcard, or email)
2. Once claimed, update the NAP
3. If claiming is not possible, use the platform's "suggest an edit" feature
4. If no edit mechanism exists, contact the platform's support directly

### Removing Duplicate Listings
1. Identify which listing is the primary (most reviews, most engagement, most accurate)
2. Report the duplicate through the platform's business tools
3. On Google: use the "Suggest an edit" > "Remove this place" > "Duplicate" option
4. On other platforms: contact support with both listing URLs and request merge or removal
5. Do not delete a listing with reviews — merge it into the primary listing if the platform supports it

### Stubborn Incorrect Citations
Some directories scrape data from aggregators and do not accept direct corrections. For these:
1. Fix the data at the aggregator level and wait for propagation (4-12 weeks)
2. If propagation does not correct the listing, contact the directory directly
3. As a last resort, use a citation management service (BrightLocal, Whitespark) that has direct relationships with directories

## Citation Management for Multi-Location Businesses

### Unique NAP Per Location
Every location must have its own distinct NAP. Common mistakes:
- Using the corporate headquarters phone number for all locations
- Using a generic corporate address for a location that has a unique street address
- Listing the franchise name without the location identifier

### Location-Specific Submission
Each location needs its own listing on every platform. For 10+ locations, manual submission is impractical. Options:
- **Citation management platforms**: BrightLocal, Yext, Synup, RIO SEO manage bulk submissions
- **Data aggregator bulk feeds**: Submit all location data to aggregators in one structured data feed
- **Centralized spreadsheet**: Maintain a master location data spreadsheet that feeds all submission processes

### Consistency Challenges at Scale
- Staff turnover leads to lost login credentials for claimed listings
- Individual locations updating their own information without following formatting standards
- Franchise ownership changes creating outdated NAP data
- Temporary closures and reopenings introducing conflicting information

### Best Practices for Multi-Location
1. Maintain a single master data source (spreadsheet or database) for all location NAP data
2. Centralize login credentials for all directory accounts in a password manager
3. Assign citation management to a specific role — do not distribute across location managers
4. Audit all locations quarterly and flag discrepancies for immediate correction
5. When a location opens or closes, update all citations within the first week

## Local Link vs Citation Distinction

Citations and local links overlap but are not identical:

| | Citation | Local Link |
|---|---------|------------|
| **What it is** | NAP mention (with or without a link) | A hyperlink from a local website to yours |
| **Primary value** | Trust and verification signal for local rankings | Authority and relevance signal for domain and page rankings |
| **Example** | Business listed on Yelp with correct NAP | Local newspaper article linking to your website |
| **Do you need both?** | Yes — they serve different ranking functions | Yes — links without NAP and NAP without links are both valuable |

A citation that also includes a backlink to your website delivers double value: citation consistency for local pack rankings and link authority for organic rankings.

## Key Principle

> Citation building is not a one-time project. It is an ongoing discipline of accuracy maintenance. A business with 50 perfectly consistent citations will outrank one with 200 inconsistent citations every time. Start with data aggregators, build Tier 1 first, prioritize accuracy over volume, and audit quarterly. NAP consistency is the foundation of local SEO credibility.
