**Trigger phrases**: "technical seo," "core web vitals," "page speed," "crawl budget," "robots.txt," "sitemap," "redirect," "canonical," "indexation," "noindex," "hreflang," "javascript seo," "mobile-first indexing," "log file analysis," "site architecture," "internal linking," "crawl errors," "HTTP status," "schema markup," "structured data," "site migration," "TTFB," "LCP," "INP," "CLS," "render blocking," "crawlability," "index bloat," "redirect chain," "mixed content," "HTTPS"

## Brand Context (Auto-Applied)

Before producing any marketing output from this module:

1. **Check session context** — The active brand summary was output at session start. Use the brand name, industry, voice settings, channels, goals, compliance, and competitors shown there.
2. **If you need the full profile**, read: `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`
3. **Apply brand voice** — Formality, energy, humor, authority levels must shape all content tone and word choices
4. **Check compliance** — Auto-apply rules for brand's target_markets and industry using `skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`
5. **Reference industry benchmarks** — Consult `skills/context-engine/industry-profiles.md` for the brand's industry
6. **Use platform specs** — Reference `skills/context-engine/platform-specs.md` for character limits and format requirements
7. **Check campaign history** — Run `python campaign-tracker.py --brand {slug} --action list-campaigns` before planning new work
8. **If no brand exists**, say: "No brand profile found. Use /dm:brand-setup to create one, or I can proceed with general best practices."
9. **Check brand guidelines** — If `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/guidelines/_manifest.json` exists, load and enforce: `restrictions.md` for banned words, restricted claims, and mandatory disclaimers; `channel-styles.md` for channel-specific tone overrides (may differ from base voice); `messaging.md` for approved key messages, taglines, and positioning language; `voice-and-tone.md` for detailed voice rules beyond the 4 numeric scores. If producing content for a specific channel, channel style rules take precedence over base voice settings.

Do not ask the user for information that already exists in their brand profile.

## Required Context

Before executing technical SEO work, gather:

1. **Website URL**: The domain to audit or optimize
2. **CMS / Platform**: WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, custom, headless, etc. — determines implementation paths
3. **Hosting Environment**: Shared, VPS, dedicated, cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), CDN provider — affects server-side recommendations
4. **Current Performance Data**: Google Search Console access, PageSpeed Insights scores, CrUX data, or existing audit reports
5. **Site Scale**: Approximate page count (hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands) — determines crawl budget relevance
6. **Rendering Method**: Static HTML, server-side rendered, client-side rendered (React/Angular/Vue), hybrid (Next.js/Nuxt) — critical for JavaScript SEO
7. **International Presence**: Target countries and languages, current URL structure for international versions
8. **Known Issues**: Existing problems the user is aware of (crawl errors, indexation drops, speed complaints, ranking losses)
9. **Migration Plans**: Any upcoming domain changes, platform migrations, or URL restructuring
10. **Tech Stack Constraints**: Development team availability, deployment processes, CDN limitations, plugin/extension restrictions

For quick diagnostic requests (e.g., "why is my page slow"), infer reasonable defaults and deliver immediately. For comprehensive audits, gather full context.

## Process

**Primary Workflow: Technical SEO Audit & Optimization**

1. **Site Health Snapshot**
   - Pull current Core Web Vitals from CrUX or PageSpeed Insights (LCP, INP, CLS for mobile and desktop)
   - Review Google Search Console index coverage report (valid, excluded, error, warning counts)
   - Check for manual actions or security issues in GSC
   - Note current crawl stats (pages crawled per day, average response time, crawl errors)
   - Baseline: Document current organic traffic, indexed page count, and ranking positions for target keywords

2. **Crawlability Analysis**
   - Review robots.txt for blocking issues (critical resources, CSS/JS, important directories)
   - Validate XML sitemap (well-formed, all important pages included, no non-indexable URLs, within 50K URL / 50MB limit)
   - Assess crawl budget allocation (are crawlers spending time on low-value pages?)
   - Check for crawl traps (infinite calendar pagination, session IDs in URLs, faceted navigation generating millions of URLs)
   - Verify Googlebot can access all critical resources (CSS, JS, images needed for rendering)

3. **Indexation Review**
   - Audit canonical tags across page templates (self-referencing, cross-domain, parameterized URLs)
   - Check for conflicting directives (canonical pointing to page A while noindex is set)
   - Review meta robots directives across templates
   - Identify index bloat (thin content, tag pages, internal search results, parameter variations)
   - Verify pagination handling (paginated series, rel=canonical on component pages)
   - Check for unintended noindex tags (common after staging-to-production migration)

4. **Site Architecture Assessment**
   - Map URL structure and identify depth issues (critical pages beyond 3 clicks from homepage)
   - Analyze internal linking patterns (pages with high/low internal link counts, orphan pages)
   - Evaluate information architecture (logical grouping, topic clusters, content silos)
   - Review navigation structure (header, footer, sidebar, breadcrumbs)
   - Check URL format consistency (trailing slashes, case sensitivity, parameter handling)

5. **Page Speed Deep Dive**
   - **LCP optimization**: Identify the LCP element, check server response time (TTFB < 800ms), audit render-blocking resources, verify image optimization (format, size, lazy loading, preload for above-fold)
   - **INP optimization**: Identify long tasks (> 50ms), audit event handlers, check for main thread blocking, review third-party script impact
   - **CLS optimization**: Check for images/iframes without explicit dimensions, dynamic content injection above the fold, web font loading causing layout shift, ad slot reservations
   - Audit third-party scripts for performance impact (tag managers, analytics, chat widgets, A/B testing tools)
   - Review caching headers (Cache-Control, ETag, Expires) and CDN configuration

6. **Mobile-First Compliance Check**
   - Verify content parity between mobile and desktop rendered versions
   - Check for mobile-specific rendering issues (viewport configuration, touch targets, font sizes)
   - Test mobile page speed separately (mobile networks have higher latency)
   - Review structured data presence on mobile version (must match desktop)
   - Check for lazy-loaded content that Googlebot might miss on mobile

7. **JavaScript SEO Evaluation**
   - Determine rendering strategy (CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR, hybrid)
   - Test Googlebot rendering using URL Inspection tool (rendered HTML vs raw HTML)
   - Check if critical content and links require JavaScript to render
   - Assess JavaScript crawl budget impact (render queue delays)
   - Review client-side routing and its impact on crawlability
   - Verify meta tags and canonicals are in the server-rendered HTML (not injected by JS)

8. **Redirect Chain Audit**
   - Identify redirect chains (more than 1 hop) and redirect loops
   - Check for mixed 301/302 usage (302s that should be 301s)
   - Audit HTTPS redirect implementation (HTTP to HTTPS, www to non-www or vice versa)
   - Verify redirects from old URLs after any past migrations
   - Assess redirect response time impact on crawl efficiency

9. **Structured Data Validation**
   - Audit existing schema markup for errors and warnings (Google Rich Results Test)
   - Identify missing schema opportunities based on content types
   - Validate JSON-LD syntax and nesting
   - Check for rich result eligibility (FAQ, HowTo, Product, Review, Breadcrumb, etc.)
   - Verify schema matches visible on-page content (no hidden/misleading markup)

10. **International SEO Review** (if applicable)
    - Validate hreflang implementation (self-referencing tags, x-default, return links)
    - Check for hreflang conflicts with canonical tags
    - Verify geotargeting settings in Google Search Console
    - Assess URL structure for international versions
    - Review content localization vs translation quality signals

11. **Security Assessment**
    - Verify full HTTPS implementation (no mixed content)
    - Check HSTS header presence and configuration
    - Review security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
    - Verify SSL certificate validity and chain
    - Check for exposed sensitive files (wp-config.php, .env, .git)

12. **Prioritized Recommendation Plan**
    - Score each finding by impact (high/medium/low) and effort (quick win/medium/major project)
    - Create an impact/effort matrix to visualize priority
    - Group recommendations into: Immediate fixes (0-48 hours), Short-term wins (1-2 weeks), Medium-term projects (2-8 weeks), Long-term strategic initiatives (2-6 months)
    - Estimate traffic recovery or growth potential for each fix category
    - Provide implementation specs for the top 5 highest-priority items

## Edge Cases

### JavaScript-Heavy Single Page Applications (React, Angular, Vue)
- **Situation**: Site renders all content client-side; Googlebot may see empty or incomplete pages
- **Approach**: Test rendered HTML using Google's URL Inspection tool and compare to source HTML. If critical content or links are missing from server response, recommend SSR (Next.js, Nuxt, Angular Universal) or static site generation. If SSR is not feasible, evaluate dynamic rendering as a stopgap (Rendertron, Puppeteer-based prerendering). Ensure meta tags, canonicals, and hreflang are in the initial HTML response, not injected by JavaScript. Audit JavaScript bundle size and hydration time as they directly impact INP.

### Large Ecommerce Sites (100K+ Pages, Faceted Navigation)
- **Situation**: Faceted navigation generates millions of URL combinations; crawl budget is consumed by low-value parameter pages
- **Approach**: Implement a canonicalization strategy for faceted URLs (canonical to the base category page unless the facet creates genuinely unique, valuable content). Use robots.txt or meta robots to block crawling of low-value parameter combinations. Create a curated internal linking strategy that directs crawlers to high-value pages. Build separate XML sitemaps for product pages, category pages, and editorial content. Monitor crawl stats to verify crawl budget is allocated to revenue-generating pages. Consider AJAX-based filtering that does not generate crawlable URLs for non-valuable combinations.

### Website Migrations (Domain, Platform, HTTPS)
- **Situation**: Business is changing domains, switching CMS platforms, or consolidating multiple sites
- **Approach**: Create a comprehensive URL mapping (old URL to new URL) before migration. Implement 301 redirects for every URL with organic traffic or backlinks. Set up monitoring for crawl errors, index coverage, and organic traffic immediately after migration. Expect a temporary ranking dip (typically 2-8 weeks for well-executed migrations). Keep the old domain/hosting active for at least 12 months to serve redirects. Verify all internal links, canonical tags, sitemaps, and hreflang tags reference the new URL structure. Run a full technical audit 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post-migration.

### Multilingual Sites with Complex Hreflang Requirements
- **Situation**: Site serves content in 10+ languages with regional variations (e.g., en-US, en-GB, en-AU, es-ES, es-MX)
- **Approach**: Use XML sitemap method for hreflang at scale (HTML link tags become unmanageable above 20+ versions). Ensure every page has self-referencing hreflang and an x-default fallback. Verify bidirectional return links (if page A points to page B with hreflang, page B must point back to page A). Watch for canonical conflicts (canonical and hreflang must reference the same URL). Automate hreflang generation through CMS or build system to prevent manual errors. Test with Google's hreflang testing tools and monitor international targeting in GSC.

### Sites with Legacy Technical Debt
- **Situation**: Years of accumulated issues — mixed HTTP/HTTPS, orphan pages, redirect chains 5+ hops deep, duplicate content across subdomains, abandoned staging environments indexed by Google
- **Approach**: Prioritize by damage — index bloat and crawl waste first (they affect the entire site), then redirect chains (they bleed PageRank), then mixed content (security and trust signals), then orphan pages (wasted content investment). Do not try to fix everything at once. Create a phased remediation plan: Phase 1 (crawl and index cleanup), Phase 2 (redirect consolidation), Phase 3 (architecture optimization). Monitor organic traffic after each phase to measure impact and catch regressions.
