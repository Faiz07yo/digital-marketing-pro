# Video Scripting Reference

## Platform-Specific Formats

| Platform | Aspect Ratio | Max Length | Optimal Length | Autoplay | Caption Support |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| YouTube (long-form) | 16:9 | 12 hours | 8-15 minutes | No (click to play) | SRT, VTT, auto-generated |
| YouTube Shorts | 9:16 | 60 seconds | 30-45 seconds | Yes (in feed) | Auto-generated, burned-in recommended |
| TikTok | 9:16 | 10 minutes | 15-60 seconds | Yes (sound on) | Auto-generated, SRT, burned-in |
| Instagram Reels | 9:16 | 90 seconds | 15-30 seconds | Yes (sound off in feed) | Auto-generated, burned-in recommended |
| Instagram Stories | 9:16 | 60 seconds (15s segments) | 15 seconds | Yes (sound off) | Burned-in only |
| LinkedIn Video | 1:1 or 16:9 | 10 minutes | 30-90 seconds | Yes (sound off) | SRT upload, burned-in recommended |
| Facebook In-Feed | 16:9, 1:1, or 4:5 | 240 minutes | 15-60 seconds | Yes (sound off) | SRT, auto-generated |
| Facebook Stories | 9:16 | 20 seconds | 15 seconds | Yes (sound off) | Burned-in only |

### Platform Behavioral Notes

1. **YouTube** — Viewers actively choose to watch; longer attention spans. Optimize for watch time and session duration. Thumbnails and titles drive clicks; the first 30 seconds determine retention.
2. **TikTok** — Sound-on environment; music and voiceover are expected. Algorithm rewards completion rate and rewatches. Authenticity outperforms polish.
3. **Instagram Reels** — Hybrid behavior; some sound-on, many sound-off. On-screen text is essential. Trending audio can boost distribution.
4. **LinkedIn** — Professional context; sound-off default. Burned-in captions are mandatory for engagement. Talking-head and thought-leadership formats perform best.
5. **Facebook** — Declining organic reach; paid distribution is primary. Sound-off default. Thumb-stopping visuals in the first frame are critical.

## Video Script Structures

| Structure | Pattern | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| AIDA | Attention > Interest > Desire > Action | Product launches, direct response ads |
| PAS | Problem > Agitate > Solve | Pain-point driven products, B2B solutions |
| Before-After-Bridge | Before state > After state > Bridge (product) | Transformation-focused products, fitness, SaaS |
| Problem-Solve-CTA | State problem > Present solution > Call to action | Short-form ads (15-30s), simple value props |
| Testimonial | Social proof hook > Customer story > Result > CTA | Trust-building, mid-funnel retargeting |
| Explainer (What-How-Why) | What it is > How it works > Why it matters | New product categories, complex offerings |
| Product Demo | Hook > Feature walkthrough > Key benefit > CTA | E-commerce, software, physical products |
| Listicle/Tips | Hook > Tip 1 > Tip 2 > Tip 3 > CTA | Educational content, thought leadership, organic social |

### Choosing a Structure

- For awareness campaigns with cold audiences, use AIDA or Before-After-Bridge to create desire.
- For consideration campaigns targeting warm audiences, use Explainer or Product Demo to educate.
- For conversion campaigns targeting hot audiences, use PAS or Testimonial to overcome objections.
- For organic/content marketing, use Listicle/Tips to deliver value and build authority.

## Hook Formulas (First 3 Seconds)

The first 3 seconds determine whether a viewer watches or scrolls. Every video script must open with a deliberate hook. Below are 12 proven patterns:

1. **Question Hook** — Open with a question the viewer wants answered.
   - Example: "Did you know 73% of carts get abandoned before checkout?"

2. **Stat Hook** — Lead with a surprising or counterintuitive statistic.
   - Example: "87% of marketers say video gives them positive ROI."

3. **Controversy Hook** — Challenge a common belief or practice.
   - Example: "Stop posting on social media every day. Here's why."

4. **Before/After Hook** — Show the transformation immediately.
   - Example: [Visual: messy dashboard] "This was our reporting..." [Visual: clean dashboard] "...and this is it now."

5. **Direct Address Hook** — Speak directly to the viewer's identity or situation.
   - Example: "If you're a SaaS founder spending more than $10K/month on ads, watch this."

6. **Pattern Interrupt Hook** — Break expectations with an unexpected visual or statement.
   - Example: [Person walks into frame and drops a stack of papers] "This is everything your team does manually that should be automated."

7. **Social Proof Hook** — Lead with credibility or numbers.
   - Example: "10,000 marketers switched to this tool last quarter. Here's what happened."

8. **Fear/Urgency Hook** — Highlight a risk or time-sensitive opportunity.
   - Example: "Google just changed its algorithm and most sites are about to lose traffic."

9. **Curiosity Gap Hook** — Tease information without revealing it.
   - Example: "There's one setting in your ad account that's wasting 30% of your budget."

10. **Demonstration Hook** — Show the product or result immediately.
    - Example: [Screen recording: 3 clicks to generate a report] "Watch how fast this is."

11. **Story Opener Hook** — Begin with a brief, relatable narrative.
    - Example: "Last month, a client came to us spending $50K on ads with zero leads. Here's what we found."

12. **Bold Claim Hook** — Make a strong, specific promise.
    - Example: "This framework doubled our conversion rate in 14 days."

### Hook Selection by Platform

- **TikTok/Reels:** Pattern interrupt, controversy, curiosity gap, bold claim (visual-first, fast-paced)
- **YouTube:** Question, story opener, stat hook (viewers chose to click, reward with depth)
- **LinkedIn:** Stat hook, direct address, social proof (professional credibility matters)
- **Facebook Ads:** Before/after, demonstration, fear/urgency (thumb-stopping in sound-off feed)

## Visual Direction Notes

### Camera Direction Vocabulary

Use these standard terms in script annotations to communicate visual intent:

- **CU (Close-Up)** — Tight framing on face or product detail; conveys emotion or highlights specific features
- **WS (Wide Shot)** — Full scene establishing context, environment, or scale
- **MS (Medium Shot)** — Waist-up framing; standard for talking-head content
- **B-Roll** — Supplementary footage that visually supports the voiceover or main content
- **Lower Third** — Text overlay in the bottom third of the screen for names, titles, or key points
- **Text Overlay** — On-screen text reinforcing spoken words; essential for sound-off viewing
- **Split Screen** — Two frames side by side for comparison (before/after, competitor vs. product)
- **Transition** — Visual shift between scenes (cut, dissolve, swipe, zoom); match to platform style
- **Screen Recording** — Capture of software/app in use; standard for product demos and tutorials
- **Talking Head** — Single person speaking directly to camera; builds trust and personal connection

### B-Roll Cue Format

In scripts, annotate B-roll cues in brackets:

```
[B-ROLL: Team working at desks, overhead angle]
[B-ROLL: Close-up of hands typing on keyboard]
[B-ROLL: Product packaging being opened]
[B-ROLL: Customer using product in real environment]
```

### On-Screen Text Timing

- Display text for a minimum of 2 seconds or long enough to read twice at normal speed
- Maximum 6-8 words per text overlay for mobile viewing
- Animate text in on the beat of the voiceover — not before, not after
- Use contrasting background (semi-transparent bar or drop shadow) for readability

### Motion Graphics Triggers

Annotate motion graphics cues in scripts as:

```
[GFX: Animated stat counter — "10,000+ customers"]
[GFX: Logo reveal with tagline]
[GFX: Step 1/2/3 numbered progression]
[GFX: Price comparison table slide-in]
```

## Audio Direction

### Voiceover Pacing

- **Standard narration:** 130-150 words per minute for clear comprehension
- **Energetic/promotional:** 150-170 words per minute for urgency and excitement
- **Thoughtful/premium:** 110-130 words per minute for gravitas and authority
- **Quick-hit social (TikTok/Reels):** 160-180 words per minute to match platform energy

For a 60-second video at standard pacing, plan for approximately 130-150 words of script.

### Music Mood Mapping

| Video Tone | Music Style | Tempo (BPM) | Instruments |
|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Upbeat/Energetic | Pop, electronic, indie | 120-140 | Synths, claps, guitar |
| Corporate/Professional | Ambient, light orchestral | 90-110 | Piano, strings, soft percussion |
| Emotional/Inspirational | Cinematic, acoustic | 70-100 | Piano, strings, vocals |
| Minimal/Clean | Lo-fi, ambient pads | 80-100 | Soft synths, minimal percussion |
| Urgent/Exciting | Driving electronic, rock | 130-160 | Drums, bass, distorted synths |
| Playful/Fun | Ukulele, whistling, bouncy | 110-130 | Acoustic guitar, xylophone, claps |

### Sound Effects Usage

- Use sound effects sparingly — 2-3 per 60-second video maximum
- Effective uses: whoosh on transitions, pop on text appearance, notification ding for CTA
- Avoid overuse; excessive sound effects feel amateurish
- Match sound effects to brand tone (tech brands: digital/clean; lifestyle brands: organic/natural)

### Silence as Emphasis

Strategic silence (0.5-1.5 seconds) after a key statement forces the viewer to process the message. Use before a major reveal, after a surprising statistic, or before the CTA. Silence is especially powerful in long-form content where viewers are accustomed to continuous audio.

## CTA Placement by Video Length

| Video Length | CTA Placement | CTA Type | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|----------|-------|
| 15 seconds | 0:13-0:15 (end only) | Single, direct | One action, no ambiguity |
| 30 seconds | 0:25-0:30 (end only) | Single, direct | Brief supporting text overlay |
| 60 seconds | 0:28-0:32 (mid) + 0:55-1:00 (end) | Soft mid + hard end | Mid-CTA can be verbal mention; end-CTA is visual + verbal |
| 2 minutes | 0:05 (tease) + 1:00 (mid) + 1:50-2:00 (end) | Tease + soft + hard | Tease: "Stay to the end for..."; mid: verbal; end: full CTA |
| 5+ minutes | Multiple soft CTAs + hard end CTA | Layered | Soft CTAs every 90-120 seconds; hard CTA in final 15 seconds |

### CTA Best Practices

1. **Be specific** — "Click the link in bio to download the free template" beats "Check it out"
2. **One primary CTA per video** — Multiple competing actions reduce conversion
3. **Verbal + visual** — Say the CTA and show it on screen simultaneously
4. **Reduce friction** — Tell the viewer exactly what happens after they take the action
5. **Match CTA to funnel stage** — Awareness: "Follow for more"; Consideration: "Watch this next"; Conversion: "Sign up now"

## Accessibility Requirements

Accessible video is not optional — it expands audience reach, improves engagement metrics, and is legally required in many contexts.

### Mandatory Elements

1. **Closed Captions** — Provide for every video, on every platform. Use platform-native caption tools or upload SRT/VTT files. Auto-generated captions must be reviewed and corrected for accuracy before publishing.

2. **Burned-In Captions** — Required for platforms that do not reliably display caption files (Instagram Stories, TikTok, most social feeds). Style guidelines:
   - Font: Sans-serif, bold weight, minimum 24pt equivalent on mobile
   - Contrast: White text on semi-transparent dark background, or outlined text
   - Position: Lower third of frame, avoiding overlap with platform UI elements
   - Timing: Sync to speech with 0.5-1 second display buffer

3. **Audio Descriptions** — When critical information is conveyed only visually (charts, on-screen text not read aloud, visual demonstrations), provide audio description either as a separate audio track or by scripting narration that describes what is shown.

4. **Transcripts** — Make full text transcripts available for long-form content. Post in video description, linked document, or companion blog post.

5. **Color Contrast for On-Screen Text** — Maintain WCAG AA minimum contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) for all text overlays, lower thirds, and graphics.

6. **Alternative Text** — When embedding video on websites, provide descriptive alt text for the video thumbnail and a text summary of video content for screen readers.
