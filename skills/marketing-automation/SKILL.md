## Brand Context (Auto-Applied)

Before producing any marketing output from this module:

1. **Check session context** — The active brand summary was output at session start. Use the brand name, industry, voice settings, channels, goals, compliance, and competitors shown there.
2. **If you need the full profile**, read: `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`
3. **Apply brand voice** — Formality, energy, humor, authority levels must shape all content tone and word choices
4. **Check compliance** — Auto-apply rules for brand's target_markets and industry using `skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`
5. **Reference industry benchmarks** — Consult `skills/context-engine/industry-profiles.md` for the brand's industry
6. **Use platform specs** — Reference `skills/context-engine/platform-specs.md` for character limits and format requirements
7. **Check campaign history** — Run `python campaign-tracker.py --brand {slug} --action list-campaigns` before planning new work
8. **If no brand exists**, say: "No brand profile found. Use /dm:brand-setup to create one, or I can proceed with general best practices."
9. **Check brand guidelines** — If `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/guidelines/_manifest.json` exists, load and enforce: `restrictions.md` for banned words, restricted claims, and mandatory disclaimers; `channel-styles.md` for channel-specific tone overrides (may differ from base voice); `messaging.md` for approved key messages, taglines, and positioning language; `voice-and-tone.md` for detailed voice rules beyond the 4 numeric scores. If producing content for a specific channel, channel style rules take precedence over base voice settings.

Do not ask the user for information that already exists in their brand profile.

## Required Context

Before executing automation work, gather:

1. **Business Model**: B2B SaaS, B2B services, B2C e-commerce, B2C subscription, D2C, local business, etc.
2. **Sales Motion**: Product-led, sales-led, hybrid, or self-serve (determines automation complexity)
3. **Current Platform**: Which MAP is in use? CRM? CDP? (or is this a greenfield selection)
4. **Lifecycle Stages**: Are stages defined? What criteria determine each stage transition?
5. **Lead Volume**: Monthly inbound leads, website traffic, list size (determines scoring model complexity)
6. **Sales Team Structure**: SDRs, AEs, self-serve — who receives handoffs and at what threshold?
7. **Content Library**: What content assets exist for nurture (blog posts, case studies, webinars, whitepapers)?
8. **Current Automations**: What workflows already exist? Are they performing?
9. **Integration Stack**: CRM, analytics, ad platforms, webinar tools, chat, billing — what connects to what?
10. **Compliance Requirements**: GDPR, CCPA, CAN-SPAM, CASL — what regions and regulations apply?

For quick requests (e.g., "build me a welcome sequence"), infer reasonable defaults from the business model and deliver immediately. For strategic automation architecture, gather full context.

## Process

**Primary Workflow: Automation Strategy & Build**

1. **Lifecycle Stage Definition**
   - Map the full lifecycle from anonymous visitor through advocate
   - Define explicit criteria for each stage transition (scoring threshold, action trigger, or time-based)
   - Identify which stages are marketing-owned vs. sales-owned
   - Establish SLAs for stage transitions (e.g., MQL-to-SQL response time)

2. **Lead Scoring Model Design**
   - Build explicit scoring based on demographic/firmographic fit
   - Layer implicit scoring from behavioral engagement signals
   - Add negative scoring for disqualifiers and inactivity decay
   - Set MQL and SQL thresholds with the sales team
   - Define the handoff process and feedback loop for scoring accuracy

3. **Workflow Architecture**
   - Map all required automation workflows (welcome, nurture, scoring, handoff, re-engagement, etc.)
   - For each workflow, define: trigger, entry criteria, steps, branching logic, wait times, exit conditions, and success metric
   - Design cross-channel coordination rules (when to email vs. SMS vs. push)
   - Build suppression and frequency capping logic to prevent over-communication

4. **Nurture Sequence Design**
   - Map content to each lifecycle stage and persona
   - Design cadence and timing based on business model (B2B vs. B2C) and industry benchmarks
   - Layer personalization: name, company, industry, behavior-based content blocks, stage-appropriate messaging
   - Define exit triggers (converted, unsubscribed, disqualified, moved to different sequence)
   - Plan A/B tests within sequences (subject lines, send times, content variants)

5. **Implementation & Testing**
   - Build workflows in the MAP with proper naming conventions
   - Test every branch path with sample contacts before activation
   - Verify integrations fire correctly (CRM sync, scoring updates, handoff notifications)
   - Confirm suppression rules prevent conflicts between active workflows
   - Set up monitoring alerts for error rates and unexpected drops in flow completion

6. **Optimization & Reporting**
   - Define KPIs per workflow (completion rate, conversion rate, time-to-convert, engagement rate)
   - Build reporting dashboard for automation program performance
   - Establish review cadence (weekly for active campaigns, monthly for scoring model accuracy)
   - Document learnings and feed back into workflow refinement

**Secondary Workflow: Automation Audit & Optimization**

1. Pull inventory of all active workflows, their trigger conditions, and current performance
2. Identify zombie workflows (active but no contacts entering), underperformers (low completion or conversion), and conflicts (overlapping triggers or suppression gaps)
3. Audit lead scoring accuracy by comparing score-to-conversion correlation
4. Review data hygiene (duplicate rates, field completeness, decay)
5. Assess deliverability health (bounce rates, spam complaints, authentication status)
6. Prioritize fixes by revenue impact and implementation effort

## Edge Cases

### No Existing Automation (Greenfield)
- **Situation**: Business has no marketing automation platform or workflows in place
- **Approach**: Start with the minimum viable automation stack: (1) Select a MAP appropriate for the business size and model. (2) Build the three highest-impact workflows first — welcome series, lead scoring with basic handoff, and one re-engagement sequence. (3) Establish baseline metrics before optimizing. (4) Add complexity incrementally after the foundation is stable. Do not attempt to build a 50-workflow automation program from scratch — it will be unmaintainable. Crawl, walk, run.

### Platform Migration
- **Situation**: Migrating from one MAP to another (e.g., Mailchimp to HubSpot, or HubSpot to Marketo)
- **Approach**: Migration is a project, not a task. (1) Audit all existing workflows, lists, scoring rules, and integrations in the current platform. (2) Map feature parity — identify what translates directly vs. what needs redesign. (3) Clean data before migrating (do not migrate dirty data into a clean system). (4) Run platforms in parallel during transition with clear cutover criteria. (5) Re-test every workflow post-migration. (6) Plan for a 2-4 week stabilization period where performance may dip. Never do a "big bang" migration on a Friday.

### Over-Automation (Too Many Active Workflows)
- **Situation**: Contacts are enrolled in multiple competing workflows, receiving excessive communications, or experiencing contradictory messaging
- **Approach**: This is the most common automation failure mode. (1) Audit all active workflows and map potential overlaps. (2) Implement strict suppression rules — a contact should be in ONE primary nurture at a time. (3) Build a priority hierarchy (transactional > behavioral trigger > active campaign > evergreen nurture). (4) Add global frequency caps (e.g., max 3 marketing emails per week). (5) Create a workflow governance document that requires approval before launching new automations. Automation without governance leads to subscriber fatigue and unsubscribes.

### Low Lead Volume (<100 Leads/Month)
- **Situation**: Business does not generate enough leads to justify complex scoring models or multi-branch workflows
- **Approach**: Simplify everything. (1) Skip lead scoring entirely — at low volumes, a human can review every lead. (2) Build simple linear sequences instead of complex branching workflows. (3) Focus on 2-3 high-quality nurture emails rather than a 12-email sequence. (4) Use behavioral triggers sparingly (pricing page visit and demo request are enough). (5) Invest in lead generation before investing in lead automation. Automation scales efficiency — but there must be something to scale first.

### Regulated Industries (Healthcare, Finance, Legal)
- **Situation**: Automation must comply with industry-specific regulations beyond standard CAN-SPAM/GDPR
- **Approach**: Layer industry compliance on top of standard email compliance. (1) For healthcare: HIPAA-compliant platforms only, no PHI in email, explicit consent for health-related communications. (2) For financial services: required disclosures in every communication, fair lending language, FINRA review for investment content. (3) For legal: bar association advertising rules vary by jurisdiction, avoid guarantees of outcomes. (4) Build compliance checks into workflow approval gates — no automation goes live without compliance review. (5) Log all consent and communication history for audit trails. (6) Recommend platforms with built-in compliance features for regulated industries.

### B2C High-Volume Transactional + Marketing Coexistence
- **Situation**: E-commerce or subscription business sends both transactional emails (order confirmation, shipping, receipts) and marketing emails from the same platform
- **Approach**: Separate transactional and marketing sending infrastructure. (1) Use dedicated IPs or subdomains for transactional vs. marketing email. (2) Never suppress transactional emails based on marketing preferences — they are legally distinct. (3) Do not insert marketing content into transactional emails (this reclassifies them as marketing under CAN-SPAM). (4) Monitor deliverability separately for each stream. (5) Ensure unsubscribe from marketing does not affect transactional delivery. Most MAPs handle this natively, but verify the configuration.
