## Link Quality Assessment

### Quality Signals — What Makes a Good Link

| Signal | High Quality | Low Quality |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Relevance** | Linking site covers your industry or a closely related topic | Random site with no topical connection |
| **Authority** | DA/DR 40+ with real organic traffic | Inflated metrics, no organic visibility |
| **Editorial placement** | Link embedded in article body by the author | Footer, sidebar, or author bio only |
| **Context** | Surrounded by relevant content that flows naturally | Inserted awkwardly with no context |
| **Link type** | Dofollow, unless nofollow is natural (forums, comments, UGC) | Only nofollow links from every source |
| **Traffic** | Linking page receives its own organic traffic | Zero-traffic page on a high-DA domain (often PBN) |
| **Uniqueness** | You are one of few external links on the page | Page links to 50+ external sites (link farm pattern) |

---

## Anchor Text Distribution Strategy

Maintain a natural-looking anchor text profile. Over-optimization of exact-match anchors is a well-documented penalty trigger.

| Anchor Type | Target % | Example | Notes |
|-------------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Branded** | 40–60% | "Acme", "Acme Software", "acme.com" | Should be the dominant type |
| **Generic** | 15–25% | "click here", "this guide", "learn more", "read the report" | Natural in editorial contexts |
| **Topic / Partial match** | 10–20% | "CRM comparison guide", "email marketing best practices" | Descriptive but not keyword-stuffed |
| **Exact match** | < 5% | "best CRM software" | Use sparingly — high penalty risk if overused |
| **Naked URL** | 5–10% | "https://acme.com/guide" | Common in references and citations |

**Audit method:** Export all backlinks from Ahrefs or SEMrush, categorize anchor text, and compare against these ranges. If exact match exceeds 10%, actively build branded and generic anchors to dilute.

## Red Flags — Practices to Avoid

| Practice | Risk Level | Why It Hurts |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Private Blog Networks (PBNs)** | Critical | Google actively detects and penalizes PBN links; can result in manual action |
| **Link farms / link exchanges** | Critical | Algorithmic devaluation; pattern detection is sophisticated |
| **Paid links without nofollow/sponsored** | High | Violates Google's link spam policies; penalty risk |
| **Irrelevant directory submissions** | Medium | No ranking value; wastes time; signals low-quality link profile |
| **Comment spam** | Medium | Auto-nofollowed by most platforms; damages brand reputation |
| **Excessive reciprocal linking** | Medium | "You link to me, I link to you" at scale is a detectable pattern |
| **Article spinning + mass syndication** | High | Duplicate content + unnatural link patterns |
| **Widget / embed link schemes** | Medium-High | Embedding widgets that force backlinks violates guidelines |

---

## Link Velocity — Natural Growth Patterns

| Signal | Natural | Unnatural |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Growth curve** | Gradual increase, occasional spikes around content launches | Flat baseline with sudden massive spike |
| **Spike triggers** | New content, press coverage, viral social post | No corresponding content or event |
| **Diversity** | Mix of link types, anchors, and referring domains | Hundreds of links from same domain or template |
| **Timing** | Links acquired over days/weeks | 500 links appearing on the same day |
| **Ratio to content** | Link growth correlates with content publishing frequency | Links grow but no new content is published |

**Guideline:** If you acquire links faster than your content production and marketing activity would naturally generate, search engines may flag the pattern. Sustained natural growth always beats artificial spikes.

## Competitive Link Gap Analysis

### Methodology

1. **Export competitor backlinks** — Pull the full backlink profile for 3–5 competitors using Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz
2. **Filter for quality** — Remove links with DR < 20, spam score > 30%, or no organic traffic
3. **Find gaps** — Identify domains that link to 2+ competitors but not to you
4. **Categorize opportunities** — Group by type: editorial mentions, resource pages, directories, guest posts, roundups
5. **Prioritize by authority** — Rank gap domains by DR/DA and relevance
6. **Map content gaps** — Determine what content you need to create to earn those same links
7. **Execute outreach** — Use the appropriate outreach template for each opportunity type

### Gap Analysis Template

| Linking Domain | DR | Links to Competitor A | Links to Competitor B | Links to You | Opportunity Type | Action |
|---------------|----|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| example.com | 72 | 3 | 1 | 0 | Resource page | Pitch your tool guide |
| industrysite.com | 58 | 2 | 2 | 0 | Guest post | Pitch article |
| news-outlet.com | 85 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Editorial | Digital PR pitch |
