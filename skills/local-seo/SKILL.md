## Brand Context (Auto-Applied)

Before producing any marketing output from this module:

1. **Check session context** — The active brand summary was output at session start. Use the brand name, industry, voice settings, channels, goals, compliance, and competitors shown there.
2. **If you need the full profile**, read: `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`
3. **Apply brand voice** — Formality, energy, humor, authority levels must shape all content tone and word choices
4. **Check compliance** — Auto-apply rules for brand's target_markets and industry using `skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`
5. **Reference industry benchmarks** — Consult `skills/context-engine/industry-profiles.md` for the brand's industry
6. **Use platform specs** — Reference `skills/context-engine/platform-specs.md` for character limits and format requirements
7. **Check campaign history** — Run `python campaign-tracker.py --brand {slug} --action list-campaigns` before planning new work
8. **If no brand exists**, say: "No brand profile found. Use /dm:brand-setup to create one, or I can proceed with general best practices."
9. **Check brand guidelines** — If `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/guidelines/_manifest.json` exists, load and enforce: `restrictions.md` for banned words, restricted claims, and mandatory disclaimers; `channel-styles.md` for channel-specific tone overrides (may differ from base voice); `messaging.md` for approved key messages, taglines, and positioning language; `voice-and-tone.md` for detailed voice rules beyond the 4 numeric scores. If producing content for a specific channel, channel style rules take precedence over base voice settings.

Do not ask the user for information that already exists in their brand profile.

## Required Context

Before executing local SEO work, gather:

1. **Business Name & Address**: Exact legal business name and full street address (or multiple addresses for multi-location)
2. **Phone Number(s)**: Primary and tracking phone numbers in use
3. **Service Areas**: Geographic areas served (cities, counties, zip codes, radius)
4. **Number of Locations**: Single location, multi-location (how many), or service area business (no storefront)
5. **GBP Access**: Does the business have a claimed and verified Google Business Profile?
6. **Current Review Profile**: Average star rating, total review count, review velocity trend, and response rate
7. **Industry/Category**: Primary business category and any secondary categories currently set
8. **Local Competitors**: Top 3-5 businesses competing for the same local searches
9. **Current Rankings**: Known local pack positions for target keywords (if tracked)
10. **Website Structure**: Does the site have individual location pages? A store locator? Location-specific content?
11. **Existing Citations**: Known directory listings (Yelp, YP, BBB, industry-specific) and their accuracy
12. **Budget & Resources**: Team capacity for review management, content creation, and ongoing citation maintenance

For quick requests (e.g., "optimize my Google Business Profile"), proceed with available information. For comprehensive local SEO strategy, gather the full context.

## Process

### Primary Workflow: Local SEO Audit & Strategy

1. **Google Business Profile Audit**
   - Verify claim and verification status
   - Assess profile completeness: name accuracy, address, phone, website, hours, categories, attributes, description, photos, posts, Q&A, products, services
   - Evaluate category selection (primary and secondary) against competitors
   - Review photo quantity, quality, and recency (benchmark: 100+ photos, updated quarterly)
   - Assess Google Posts activity and engagement
   - Check for policy violations or suspension risks

2. **NAP Consistency Audit**
   - Document the canonical NAP (the exact name, address, and phone that should appear everywhere)
   - Scan top 50 citation sources for existing listings
   - Score each listing for NAP accuracy (exact match, minor variation, major discrepancy)
   - Identify the source of discrepancies (old address, former business name, incorrect phone format)

3. **Citation Audit & Strategy**
   - Count total structured citations (directory listings)
   - Compare citation volume against top 3 local competitors
   - Identify missing citations on high-authority directories
   - Check data aggregator accuracy (Data Axle, Neustar Localeze, Foursquare)
   - Prioritize citation building by domain authority and industry relevance

4. **Local Keyword Research**
   - Map geo-modified keywords: [service] + [city], [service] + [neighborhood], [service] near me
   - Identify implicit local keywords (keywords Google treats as local without a geo modifier)
   - Analyze local search volume and competition for priority terms
   - Map keywords to pages (location pages, service pages, blog content)

5. **Location Page Assessment**
   - Audit existing location pages for content depth, uniqueness, and optimization
   - If no location pages exist, design the page template and content plan
   - Ensure each page has unique content (not just city name swapped into a template)
   - Verify local schema markup implementation on each location page

6. **Local Link Profile Analysis**
   - Identify existing links from local sources (directories, media, organizations, partners)
   - Compare local link profile against top competitors
   - Build a local link opportunity list (chambers, associations, sponsors, events, media)
   - Prioritize by authority, relevance, and acquisition difficulty

7. **Review Profile Analysis**
   - Current average rating and total volume by platform (Google, Yelp, industry-specific)
   - Review velocity trend (increasing, stable, or declining)
   - Response rate and response quality assessment
   - Sentiment analysis of recent reviews (common praise, recurring complaints)
   - Competitor review benchmarking (their rating, volume, velocity)

8. **Local Schema Review**
   - Test existing schema with Google's Rich Results Test and Schema Validator
   - Identify missing schema types (LocalBusiness, GeoCoordinates, OpeningHours, AggregateRating)
   - Recommend schema additions with implementation-ready JSON-LD

9. **Competitor Local SEO Benchmarking**
   - Identify the top 3 local pack competitors for primary keywords
   - Compare across all ranking factors: GBP completeness, reviews, citations, content, links, proximity
   - Identify the specific gaps where the business can gain competitive advantage

10. **Prioritized Local SEO Action Plan**
    - Rank all findings by impact and effort (quick wins first)
    - Create a 30/60/90-day local SEO roadmap
    - Assign specific actions with responsible parties and deadlines

## Edge Cases

### Service Area Businesses (No Physical Storefront)
SABs (plumbers, electricians, mobile services, home cleaners) cannot display a street address on GBP. Set the service area using city names or zip codes. Hide the address in GBP settings. Do not use a P.O. Box or virtual office — Google will suspend the listing. Location pages become service area pages targeting each city served. Citation building uses the hidden address consistently but relies on phone and website URL as primary identifiers. Focus content strategy on city-specific service pages rather than a single location page.

### Multi-Location Chains (50+ Locations)
At scale, manual management fails. Recommend bulk GBP management via API or third-party platforms (Yext, Rio SEO, Uberall). Implement templatized but locally unique location pages with automated data feeds for hours, staff, and offers. Centralize review response with approved templates while allowing location managers to personalize. Build reporting dashboards that benchmark locations against each other and flag underperformers. Prioritize high-revenue or underperforming locations for dedicated attention rather than spreading effort equally.

### Highly Competitive Local Markets (Restaurants, Dentists, Plumbers)
In saturated local markets, the standard playbook is table stakes — everyone has citations and reviews. Differentiation comes from: (1) review velocity and response quality that outpaces competitors, (2) GBP engagement signals from regular posts, photos, and Q&A activity, (3) local content depth that competitors do not invest in, (4) local link building from community involvement that cannot be easily replicated, and (5) hyper-local targeting at the neighborhood level rather than just the city level.

### Businesses Spanning Multiple Cities or States
When a business serves a wide geographic area, avoid creating thin doorway pages for every city. Instead, build substantial content for primary markets (with unique testimonials, case studies, team members, and service details per location) and use service area targeting in GBP for secondary markets. Prioritize the cities with the highest revenue potential. For multi-state businesses, account for different regulatory requirements by state and adjust compliance messaging accordingly.

### New Business with Zero Local Presence
Starting from scratch requires a phased approach: (1) Claim and fully optimize GBP on day one — this is the single highest-impact action. (2) Submit to the four major data aggregators within the first week. (3) Build 20-30 high-authority citations in month one (general + industry-specific). (4) Launch a review generation program immediately — the first 10-20 reviews are the hardest but most impactful. (5) Publish a fully optimized location page with local schema. (6) Begin local content and link building in month two once the foundation is set. Set expectations: meaningful local pack visibility typically takes 3-6 months for a new business in a moderately competitive market.
