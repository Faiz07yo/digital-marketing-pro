# Transcreation Framework

Comprehensive framework for transcreating marketing content across languages and cultures. Transcreation goes beyond translation — it recreates the emotional impact and commercial intent of content for a new audience, even if the words are entirely different.

---

## 1. Transcreation vs Translation vs Localization Decision Matrix

| Aspect | Translation | Localization | Transcreation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Accurate meaning transfer | Cultural adaptation | Emotional recreation |
| **What changes** | Language only | Language + formats + cultural references | May completely rewrite the content |
| **Fidelity** | High fidelity to source words | High fidelity to source meaning | High fidelity to source intent and emotion |
| **When to use** | Technical, factual, legal content | General marketing, product content | Emotional, creative, brand voice content |
| **Cost** | Low ($0.06-0.10/word with PE) | Medium ($0.08-0.15/word) | High ($0.15-0.30/word) |
| **Turnaround** | Hours to 1-2 days | 1-3 days | 3-5 days |
| **Who does it** | Translator + post-editor | Translator + cultural consultant | Copywriter in target language |
| **Examples** | Product specs, legal terms, data sheets | Website pages, emails, help articles | Slogans, CTAs, headlines, ad campaigns |

### Decision Criteria

Ask these three questions about each piece of content:

1. **Is it factual or emotional?** Factual content (specs, legal, data) gets translated. Emotional content (slogans, campaigns) gets transcreated.

2. **Does it reference cultural elements?** If it mentions holidays, cultural norms, humor, or local customs, it needs at minimum localization. If those cultural elements ARE the message (humor-driven ad, culturally-specific metaphor), it needs transcreation.

3. **Does it rely on wordplay, rhythm, or sound?** Any content where the impact depends on how it sounds in the source language (rhymes, puns, alliteration, double meanings) must be transcreated because the linguistic mechanics cannot transfer.

**Rule of thumb:** If changing the words would destroy the value, translate. If changing the cultural frame would destroy the value, localize. If changing the feeling would destroy the value, transcreate.

## 2. Transcreation Brief Template

Every piece of content requiring transcreation needs a brief. This brief is the single most important document in the transcreation process — it tells the target-language copywriter what to achieve without constraining how they achieve it.

```markdown
## Transcreation Brief

### Source Content
[The original text exactly as written]

### Intent
[What is this content trying to DO? Inform, persuade, excite, reassure, create urgency, build trust, entertain, inspire?]

### Emotional Goal
[How should the reader FEEL after reading this? Confident, curious, urgent, inspired, amused, reassured, excited, empowered?]

### Key Message
[The ONE core idea that MUST survive transcreation, even if every word changes. Express this as a concept, not as text.]

### Cultural Context
[Why does this content work in the source culture? What assumptions, references, or cultural knowledge does it rely on?]

### Target Audience
- Demographics: [Age, gender, income, education, location]
- Psychographics: [Values, interests, lifestyle, media consumption]
- Cultural references they understand: [Pop culture, local humor, shared experiences]
- Their relationship with the brand: [New, familiar, loyal]

### Brand Voice in Target Market
[How does the brand sound in this specific market? This may differ from the source market brand voice. A brand that sounds "bold and irreverent" in the US might sound "confident and innovative" in Japan.]

### Constraints
- Character/word limits: [Platform-specific limits]
- Legal/compliance: [Required disclaimers, prohibited claims]
- Visual context: [What appears alongside this text — image, video, layout]
- Format: [Headline, body copy, CTA, social post, email subject line]

### Do-Not-Translate Terms
[Brand names, product names, technical terms that must remain in the source language or use an approved translation from the glossary]

### Reference Materials
[Links to brand guidelines, previous transcreations in this language, competitor examples in this market]

## 3. Cultural Adaptation Dimensions with Regional Examples

### Humor

| Culture | Humor Style | Marketing Application |
|---|---|---|
| **US** | Sarcasm, self-deprecation, absurdist, pop culture references | Humor-driven social media, irreverent brand voices work well |
| **UK** | Understatement, irony, dry wit, self-deprecating | Subtle humor lands better than loud comedy; cleverness valued |
| **Germany** | Precision-based, factual humor, Schadenfreude | Humor is appreciated but must not undermine credibility; wordplay works |
| **Japan** | Visual gags, kawaii, situational humor, manzai (double-act comedy) | Cute and visual humor translates to marketing; avoid sarcasm entirely |
| **Brazil** | Warmth, playfulness, double meanings, self-aware humor | Brazilian audiences love humor; warmth and irreverence both work |
| **India** | Family situations, Bollywood references, jugaad (creative improvisation) | Family-centered humor is universal; regional references vary dramatically |
| **South Korea** | Aegyo (cute), self-deprecating relatable content, meme culture | Relatability and cuteness drive engagement; formal humor for premium brands |
| **France** | Intellectual wit, wordplay, sophistication | Humor should feel clever, not obvious; never dumb-down |

### Social Proof

| Culture | Primary Trust Signal | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **US** | Individual testimonials, star ratings, "as seen on" | "Sarah from Austin saved $2,000 in her first month" |
| **Japan** | Consensus, popularity, TV appearances, long history | "Chosen by 3 million families. Established 1952." |
| **Germany** | Expert certification, test results, TUV/Stiftung Warentest | "Rated 'Very Good' by Stiftung Warentest 2025" |
| **India** | Celebrity endorsement, family approval, certifications | "Recommended by Dr. Sharma. Trusted by 50 lakh families." |
| **South Korea** | Peer group adoption, beauty/lifestyle influencers | "The serum Korean dermatologists use themselves" |
| **Brazil** | Reclame Aqui rating, influencer recommendations, community | "Rated 'Great' on Reclame Aqui. Join 2 million happy customers." |
| **Middle East** | Authority endorsement, family values, religious appropriateness | "Halal certified. Trusted by families across the region." |

### Urgency Tactics

| Culture | Approach | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **US/UK** | Direct urgency, countdown timers, scarcity | "Only 3 left! Sale ends tonight!" |
| **Japan** | Seasonal appropriateness, harmony with timing | "A spring gift for yourself. Available while the cherry blossoms last." |
| **Germany** | Logical urgency, practical reasons to act | "Early registration ensures your preferred date. Spaces are limited." |
| **France** | Elegance, discovery, invitation | "Discover our new collection. For those who appreciate the exceptional." |
| **India** | Festival timing, family value, savings emphasis | "Diwali Dhamaka! Up to 70% off. Gift your family the best." |
| **Brazil** | Community excitement, FOMO through community | "Thousands are already enjoying it. Don't be the last to discover!" |

### Trust Signals

| Culture | Primary Trust Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **US** | Money-back guarantee, BBB rating, free trial |
| **Germany** | TUV certification, Stiftung Warentest, DIN standards, Trusted Shops seal |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Red** | Excitement, sale, urgency | Luck, prosperity, celebration | Energy, vitality, warning | Auspicious, bridal, fertility | Danger, caution |
| **White** | Purity, clean, minimal | Mourning, death | Mourning, purity (context-dependent) | Mourning, peace | Purity, peace |
| **Green** | Nature, money, go | Fertility, health, harmony | Youth, energy, nature | Islam (respectful use), fertility | Islam, paradise, prosperity |
| **Yellow** | Happiness, caution, value | Royalty, nourishment | Courage, nobility | Commerce, spring | Happiness, prosperity |
| **Black** | Luxury, sophistication, death | Authority, stability | Formality, mystery | Evil, negativity, rebellion | Mourning, mystery |
| **Blue** | Trust, corporate, calm | Immortality, healing | Trust, everyday | Strength, bravery (Krishna) | Safety, heaven, spirituality |

## 4. Common Pitfalls

### Linguistic Pitfalls

- **Literal idiom translation**: "It's raining cats and dogs" becomes meaningless or absurd in most languages. Every idiom must be replaced with a culturally equivalent expression or rewritten.
- **False friends**: Words that look similar across languages but mean different things. "Gift" means poison in German. "Actual" means current in Spanish. "Preservative" means condom in French.
- **Tone/register mismatch**: Using informal language in a formal market or vice versa. Japanese marketing in the wrong keigo level damages brand credibility. French copy using "tu" when "vous" is expected feels disrespectful.
- **Gendered language**: Many languages have grammatical gender that affects adjectives, articles, and verb forms. "Your account is ready" may need different translations depending on whether the user is male or female — or the copy must be restructured to avoid the issue.

### Cultural Pitfalls

- **Hand gestures and body language in imagery**: Thumbs-up is offensive in parts of the Middle East. OK sign is vulgar in Brazil. Pointing with one finger is rude in many Asian cultures. Audit all visual assets.
- **Religious symbols and references**: Cross, crescent, Om — using religious imagery in marketing is risky. Even secular references ("Christmas sale") may exclude or offend in multi-faith markets.
- **Calendar assumptions**: Not all markets follow the Gregorian calendar for business (Islamic calendar, Chinese lunisolar calendar). Fiscal years differ. Work weeks differ (Sunday-Thursday in much of the Middle East).
- **Food and dietary references**: Pork references inappropriate in Muslim and Jewish markets. Beef references sensitive in Hindu markets. Alcohol references prohibited in many markets.

### Formatting Pitfalls

- **Number formatting**: 1,000.00 (US/UK) vs 1.000,00 (DE/FR/BR) vs 1 000,00 (FR sometimes) vs 1,000.00 (JP). Get this wrong in pricing and you have a serious problem.
- **Name ordering**: First-Last (Western) vs Last-First (JP, KR, CN, HU). Form fields, greetings, and personalization must adapt.
- **Address formatting**: Varies wildly. Japan goes from large to small (postal code, prefecture, city, ward, block, building, name). US goes small to large (name, street, city, state, zip).
- **Measurement units**: Imperial (US) vs Metric (nearly everyone else). Always convert. Don't assume.
- **Paper sizes**: A4 (international) vs Letter (US/CA). Affects PDF layouts, print collateral.

## 5. CTA Transcreation Guide

CTAs are one of the highest-impact areas for transcreation. A direct translation of "Buy Now" can feel aggressive, weak, or culturally inappropriate depending on the market.

### By Cultural Approach

**Direct urgency (US, UK, AU)**
- "Get Started Now"
- "Don't Miss Out"
- "Limited Time Offer"
- "Claim Your Free Trial"
- "Shop the Sale"
- Characteristics: Action verbs, time pressure, individual benefit, imperative mood

**Relationship-oriented (JP, KR)**
- "Let's begin together" (一緒に始めましょう)
- "Join our community"
- "We're here when you're ready" (ご準備ができましたら)
- "Learn more at your pace"
- Characteristics: Inclusive language, no pressure, respect for the reader's autonomy, polite forms

**Authority-driven (DE, AT, CH)**
- "Expert-recommended solution" (Von Experten empfohlen)
- "Certified and tested" (Zertifiziert und geprüft)
- "Proven by [authority]"
- "Request your consultation" (Beratung anfordern)
- Characteristics: Credibility, evidence, formal tone, factual claims

**Value-centered (IN, SEA)**
- "Best value for your family"
- "Smart choice for smart shoppers"
- "Save more today"
- "Special family offer"
- Characteristics: Savings emphasis, family benefit, practical value, inclusive

**Elegance-focused (FR, IT)**
- "Discover" (Decouvrez)
- "Experience the difference" (Vivez la difference)
- "Elevate your routine"
- "Explore our collection"
- Characteristics: Sophistication, invitation, sensory language, no hard sell

**Community-driven (BR, LATAM)**
- "Join thousands who already..."
- "Recommended by friends like you"
- "For you and your loved ones"
- "Be part of something special"
- Characteristics: Social proof, warmth, community belonging, personal connection

### CTA Length Considerations

Different languages have different natural CTA lengths:
- English: 2-5 words ("Get Started Free")
- German: 3-6 words, often longer due to compound words ("Jetzt kostenlos starten")
- Japanese: 5-15 characters, sometimes shorter in meaning ("今すぐ始める")
- Arabic: May be longer due to verb conjugation patterns; RTL button width must accommodate

Always design button and CTA containers with flexible widths when building multilingual templates.

## 6. Headline and Slogan Transcreation: 5-Step Process

### Step 1: Deconstruct the Original

Break down the source content into its component parts:

- **Literal meaning**: What do the words say?
- **Emotional meaning**: What do the words make you feel?
- **Wordplay**: Is there a pun, double meaning, rhyme, alliteration, or rhythm?
- **Cultural reference**: Does it reference something specific to the source culture?
- **Brand connection**: How does it connect to the brand's identity and positioning?

Example — "Think Different" (Apple):
- Literal: Consider unconventional ideas
- Emotional: Empowerment, rebellion, creativity, confidence
- Wordplay: Grammatically unexpected ("different" as adverb), creates pause
- Cultural reference: Counterculture, Silicon Valley innovation ethos
- Brand connection: Apple as the choice of creative nonconformists

### Step 2: Create the Brief

Document what the transcreation must achieve (not what it must say). Use the Transcreation Brief Template from Section 2. The brief for "Think Different" might say:

- Intent: Position the brand as the choice of creative, independent thinkers
- Emotional goal: Empowerment, confidence in being unconventional
- Key message: Using this brand means you see the world differently (and that's a good thing)
- Constraints: Must be 2-4 words, work as a visual tagline, pair with portrait imagery

### Step 3: Create 3-5 Options in the Target Language

The copywriter creates original options in the target language. These are NOT translations — they are new creative executions that achieve the brief's goals.

Example for Japanese:
1. "異なる考え方" (A different way of thinking) — direct, minimal
2. "常識を超えろ" (Surpass common sense) — imperative, bold
3. "自分らしく考える" (Think in your own way) — personal, empowering
4. "型にはまるな" (Don't fit the mold) — rebellious, colloquial

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Option

Score each option against these criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 | Option 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intent preservation | 30% | Does it position the brand for creative thinkers? | | | |
| Cultural resonance | 25% | Does it feel natural in the target culture? | | | |
| Brand voice | 20% | Does it sound like the brand in this market? | | | |
| Creativity | 15% | Is it memorable and well-crafted? | | | |
| Constraint compliance | 10% | Does it meet length and format requirements? | | | |

### Step 5: Test and Validate

- Use `/dm:multilingual-score` to get automated quality scoring
- Use `/dm:prompt-test` to A/B test variants with audience descriptions
- Have a native speaker from the target market review the shortlisted option
- Test in context (mockup with actual layout, imagery, and surrounding content)

### Real-World Before/After Examples

**Nike "Just Do It"**
- China: "用运动征服一切" (Conquer everything through sport) — shifted from individual willpower to achievement through action, resonating with collectivist achievement values
- Japan: "ただやれ" was NOT used (too blunt). Campaigns use longer aspirational copy instead.
- Germany: "Just Do It" kept in English — the English phrase carries aspirational, international cachet

**McDonald's "I'm Lovin' It"**
- China: "我就喜欢" (I just like it) — simplified the emotion to a natural Chinese expression of casual preference
- Germany: "Ich liebe es" (I love it) — direct translation worked because the sentiment is universal and the melody carried
- Japan: Used the English tagline with Japanese pronunciation, leveraging Western brand appeal

**De Beers "A Diamond Is Forever"**
- China: "钻石恒久远，一颗永流传" (A diamond lasts forever, one piece passed on eternally) — added the concept of generational legacy, deeply resonant in Chinese culture
- Japan: "ダイヤモンドは永遠の輝き" (A diamond is an eternal sparkle) — shifted from permanence to beauty, aligning with aesthetic values

## 7. Humor in Translation

### What Transfers Across Languages

- **Visual humor**: Sight gags, unexpected visuals, visual metaphors — these work across cultures because they don't depend on language
- **Universal situations**: Spilling coffee, alarm clocks, Monday mornings, pets being mischievous — shared human experiences that need minimal adaptation
- **Exaggeration of common experiences**: "That feeling when..." content often transfers because the underlying situation is universal
- **Physical comedy references**: Slapstick-style humor described in text can often be translated directly

### What Does NOT Transfer

- **Puns and wordplay**: By definition, puns depend on the mechanics of a specific language. They must be replaced with equivalent wordplay in the target language or replaced with a different humor mechanism entirely.
- **Sarcasm**: Sarcasm is beloved in US/UK/AU marketing but confuses or offends in many Asian and Middle Eastern markets. Japanese, Korean, and Chinese audiences may interpret sarcastic statements literally.
- **Pop culture references**: A reference to a TV show, movie, or celebrity that's unknown in the target market falls completely flat. Replace with a locally relevant reference that serves the same function.
- **Slang and colloquialisms**: "That's fire" or "no cap" are generation-specific, language-specific, and often untranslatable. Use target-language slang that conveys the same energy.
- **Double entendres**: Sexual or suggestive wordplay has vastly different acceptability across cultures. What's playfully edgy in Brazil may be offensive in Saudi Arabia or simply confusing in Japan.

### Decision Framework for Humor Transfer

```
Is the humor based on language mechanics (pun, wordplay, rhyme)?
  YES → Must be fully transcreated. Create new humor in target language.
  NO  ↓

Is the humor based on a cultural reference (TV show, celebrity, historical event)?
  YES → Replace with equivalent local reference that serves the same function.
  NO  ↓

Is the humor based on a universal situation or visual?
  YES → Likely translatable with minor adaptation. Test with native speaker.
  NO  ↓

Is the humor based on tone (sarcasm, irony, understatement)?
  YES → Check cultural compatibility. Sarcasm does NOT work in JP, KR, CN, most of SEA.
        Replace with culturally appropriate tone: warmth, cleverness, or surprise.
```

### Safe Alternatives When Humor Doesn't Transfer

When the source humor mechanism won't work in the target culture, replace it with:

- **Warmth**: A genuine, friendly tone that creates positive feeling without trying to be funny
- **Cleverness**: A smart observation or unexpected connection that makes the reader feel intelligent
- **Surprise**: An unexpected twist that delights without relying on language-specific humor
- **Relatability**: "We've all been there" content that creates connection through shared experience
- **Charm**: Light, pleasant, endearing tone that creates goodwill without explicit jokes

## 8. Quality Rubric for Transcreated Content

Score transcreated content across five dimensions on a 0-100 scale.

### Dimension 1: Intent Preservation (30% weight)

Does the transcreated version achieve the same communication goal as the original?

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 90-100 | Achieves the same goal with equal or greater effectiveness. A reader in the target market would take the intended action. |
| 75-89 | Achieves the same goal but with slightly less impact. The core message is clear and compelling. |
| 60-74 | The goal is recognizable but diluted. Some intent is lost. Needs revision. |
| 40-59 | The goal is partially achieved but significant intent is missing. Re-transcreate. |
| 0-39 | The goal is lost entirely. The transcreation fails to communicate the intended message. Start over. |

### Dimension 2: Cultural Resonance (25% weight)

Does the content feel native to the target culture?

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 90-100 | Reads as if it was originally written for this market. Uses culturally natural references, metaphors, and rhythm. |
| 75-89 | Feels natural with minor moments of unfamiliarity. A local reader would not immediately identify it as translated. |
| 60-74 | Recognizably adapted from another culture. Functional but not native-feeling. |
| 40-59 | Contains cultural missteps or feels foreign. Would stand out negatively to a local reader. |
| 0-39 | Culturally inappropriate, offensive, or completely disconnected from the target audience's reality. |

### Dimension 3: Brand Voice (20% weight)

Does the transcreation maintain the brand's personality as adapted for this market?

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 90-100 | Unmistakably the brand's voice, naturally adapted for the target market's communication norms. |
| 75-89 | Recognizable as the brand, with minor voice inconsistencies. |
| 60-74 | Generic marketing voice. Could be any brand. Lacks personality. |
| 40-59 | Voice conflicts with brand positioning. Tone is wrong for the brand in this market. |
| 0-39 | Completely off-brand. Would confuse or alienate existing customers. |

### Dimension 4: Creativity (15% weight)

Is the transcreation well-crafted, memorable, and engaging in the target language?

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 90-100 | Excellent craft. Memorable, quotable, and stands on its own as creative work. |
| 75-89 | Good craft. Engaging and well-written, though not exceptional. |
| 60-74 | Adequate. Gets the job done but is unremarkable. Forgettable. |
| 40-59 | Flat or awkward. Lacks energy or reads as placeholder copy. |
| 0-39 | Poorly written. Clumsy, confusing, or amateurish in the target language. |

### Dimension 5: Constraint Compliance (10% weight)

Does the transcreation meet all technical and legal requirements?

| Score | Criteria |
|---|---|
| 90-100 | All constraints met perfectly. Character limits, platform requirements, legal disclaimers, do-not-translate terms. |
| 75-89 | Minor constraint issues that can be quickly fixed (e.g., 2 characters over limit). |
| 60-74 | One or more constraints violated but fixable without major rewriting. |
| 40-59 | Multiple constraint violations requiring significant rework. |
| 0-39 | Critical constraints violated (legal compliance, brand name errors, platform incompatibility). |

### Scoring Thresholds

| Weighted Score | Action |
|---|---|
| **85-100** | Approve for publication. No further review required. |
| **70-84** | Send for native speaker review. Minor revisions expected. |
| **50-69** | Return for revision with specific feedback on weak dimensions. |
| **Below 50** | Re-transcreate from scratch. The current version is not salvageable. |

### Using the Rubric

1. Score each dimension independently
2. Apply weights: (Intent x 0.30) + (Cultural x 0.25) + (Voice x 0.20) + (Creativity x 0.15) + (Constraints x 0.10)
3. Compare against thresholds
4. Document scores and feedback for the transcreation team to improve over time
5. Use `/dm:multilingual-score` for automated pre-screening before human rubric evaluation
