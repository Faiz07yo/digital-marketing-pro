### Battle Card Best Practices

- [ ] Keep to 1-2 pages maximum — sales reps will not read a 10-page document
- [ ] Be honest about competitor strengths — reps lose credibility if they dismiss real advantages
- [ ] Update quarterly or when competitors release major features/pricing changes
- [ ] Include trap questions that reps can ask naturally in discovery calls
- [ ] Source weaknesses from customer feedback, G2 reviews, and competitive wins analysis
- [ ] Include at least 2 customer proof points (quotes from wins against this competitor)
- [ ] Mark confidential and do not share externally
- [ ] Test with sales team — revise based on which sections they actually use

## Sales Email Templates

### Cold Outreach (Pattern Interrupt)

```
Subject: [Specific observation about their company]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [specific, researched observation — recent hire, product launch,
funding round, job posting, technology change].

Companies in [their industry] going through [that situation] typically
face [specific challenge you solve]. [Company similar to theirs] tackled
this by [brief solution mention] and saw [one specific result].

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see if something similar could work
for [their company]?

[Your name]
```

### Follow-Up (Value-Add)

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject] — thought this was relevant

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share [specific resource: case study, industry report, benchmark
data] — it covers how [similar company/industry] is handling [the challenge
you mentioned in outreach].

Key takeaway: [one compelling stat or insight from the resource].

Happy to walk through how this applies to [their company] specifically.

[Your name]
```

### Breakup Email (Final Attempt)

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back — no worries at all.

I'll assume the timing isn't right and close your file. If [the challenge
you solve] becomes a priority, my door is always open.

In the meantime, here's [valuable resource] that might be useful regardless.

All the best,
[Your name]
```

### Competitive Displacement

```
Subject: Quick question about [Competitor product]

Hi [First Name],

I work with several companies that switched from [Competitor] to [Your product].
The most common reasons were [reason 1] and [reason 2].

[Customer name] made the switch 6 months ago and saw [specific result].

Curious — are you experiencing any of those same challenges with [Competitor]?

If it's working well for you, that's great. But if you're open to seeing what
[specific improvement] looks like, I'd love to show you in 15 minutes.

[Your name]
```

### Referral Request

```
Subject: Quick favor, [First Name]?

Hi [First Name],

Glad to hear [positive outcome or recent success with your product]. That's
exactly the kind of result we love seeing.

I'm wondering — do you know anyone in [specific role] at a [similar company
type] who might be facing the same challenges you were before we started
working together?

A warm intro would mean a lot. Happy to make it easy — I can draft a short
blurb you could forward if that helps.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

## Objection Handling Library

### Framework: Acknowledge, Reframe, Close (ARC)

```
1. Acknowledge — Validate the concern (never dismiss it)
2. Reframe — Provide new context or perspective
3. Close — Move the conversation forward with a question or next step
```

### Price Objections

| Objection | Response Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "It's too expensive" | **Acknowledge:** "I understand — budget is always a factor." **Reframe:** "Let's look at the cost of *not* solving [problem]. [Customer] was spending $X/month on [current approach] and getting [poor result]. After switching, they saved $Y/month while getting [better result]." **Close:** "Would it help if we built a quick ROI projection specific to your numbers?" |
| "Competitor X is cheaper" | **Acknowledge:** "They do have a lower price point." **Reframe:** "What we hear from teams that evaluated both is that [specific differentiator] ends up saving more in the long run. [Customer who switched] found that [Competitor]'s approach cost them [hidden cost]." **Close:** "Would it be useful to see a total cost of ownership comparison?" |
| "We don't have budget this quarter" | **Acknowledge:** "That makes sense — timing matters." **Reframe:** "What if we map out what [problem] will cost over the next quarter while you wait? We can also structure a start date that aligns with your budget cycle." **Close:** "When does your next budget period start? Let's plan around that." |

### Timing Objections

| Objection | Response Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Now is not a good time" | **Acknowledge:** "I get it — timing is everything." **Reframe:** "Most of our customers said the same thing before they started. [Customer] started during [busy period] and the implementation actually helped them manage the load." **Close:** "What would need to be true for the timing to feel right?" |
| "We're locked into a contract" | **Acknowledge:** "That's common." **Reframe:** "Many of our customers started planning while their contract was still active so they could transition seamlessly." **Close:** "When does your current contract end? Let's set up a timeline that starts before then." |

### Status Quo Objections

| Objection | Response Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We're fine with what we have" | **Acknowledge:** "If it's working, I wouldn't suggest changing." **Reframe:** "What I'm hearing from others in [their industry] is that what worked last year isn't keeping up with [market change]. [Customer] felt the same way until they realized they were leaving [specific metric] on the table." **Close:** "Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if there's an opportunity you might be missing?" |
| "We built something internally" | **Acknowledge:** "That shows your team is resourceful." **Reframe:** "Internal tools often work well initially. The challenge we hear about is maintenance, scaling, and opportunity cost of engineering time. [Customer] maintained their internal tool for 2 years before they realized [cost of internal maintenance]." **Close:** "What's the total cost of maintaining your internal solution — including engineering hours?" |

### Competitor Objections

| Objection | Response Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We're evaluating [Competitor]" | **Acknowledge:** "Good — they're a solid company to evaluate." **Reframe:** "What I'd encourage you to ask them is [trap question from battle card]. We find the biggest differences show up in [specific area]. [Customer] evaluated both and chose us because [differentiator]." **Close:** "Would it help if I shared a side-by-side comparison on the areas that matter most to you?" |

## Sales Content Metrics Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track

- [ ] Collect feedback from top 5 performing reps on what content they wish existed
- [ ] Update email templates based on reply rate data
- [ ] Refresh case studies older than 18 months with updated metrics
- [ ] Verify all links, attachments, and downloads are working
- [ ] Align new content with any product launches, feature releases, or positioning changes
- [ ] Review win/loss analysis for new objection patterns requiring content response

*Sales enablement is not about creating more content. It is about creating the right content, making it findable, and ensuring it gets used at the right moment in the right deal. Every asset should earn its place by measurably helping reps close deals.*
