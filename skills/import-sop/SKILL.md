# /dm:import-sop

## Purpose

Import and structure agency Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that apply across all clients. SOPs define **how work gets done** — approval workflows, content review steps, campaign launch checklists, escalation procedures, and quality gates.

SOPs are stored at the agency level (`~/.claude-marketing/sops/`), not per-brand, so they apply consistently across all clients.

## Input Required

The user provides:

- **SOP content**: Pasted workflow steps, checklist items, or process descriptions
- **SOP name**: What this SOP covers (e.g., "content-approval", "campaign-launch", "crisis-escalation")
- **Description** (optional): Brief summary of when this SOP applies

If the user doesn't provide a name, infer it from the content.

## Process

1. **Load brand context**: Read `~/.claude-marketing/brands/_active-brand.json` for the active slug, then load `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`. Apply brand voice, compliance rules for target markets (`skills/context-engine/compliance-rules.md`), and industry context. **Also check for existing guidelines** at `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/guidelines/_manifest.json` — if present, load restrictions and relevant category files. Check for custom templates at `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/templates/`. Check for agency SOPs at `~/.claude-marketing/sops/`. If no brand exists, ask: "Set up a brand first (/dm:brand-setup)?" — or proceed with defaults.

2. **Classify the SOP type**:
   - **Content workflow**: Review, approval, and publishing steps for content
   - **Campaign checklist**: Pre-launch, launch, and post-launch verification steps
   - **Escalation procedure**: Who to contact, decision authority, response timelines
   - **Quality assurance**: Testing steps, brand compliance checks, accessibility verification
   - **Client onboarding**: Steps for setting up a new client in the system
   - **Reporting workflow**: Data collection, analysis, presentation, delivery steps

3. **Structure into actionable steps**:
   - Number each step clearly
   - Identify decision points (if/then branches)
   - Mark which steps require human approval vs. automated checks
   - Add role assignments where mentioned (who does what)
   - Include timelines/SLAs where provided
   - Flag any steps the plugin can automate vs. steps requiring human action

4. **Check for existing SOPs** — If an SOP with this name already exists:
   - Show the current SOP content
   - Ask: merge (combine steps), replace (overwrite), or cancel
   - When merging, deduplicate and maintain step order

5. **Save the SOP**:
   - Save using `guidelines-manager.py --action save-sop --name {name} --content "{content}"`
   - Or write directly to `~/.claude-marketing/sops/{name}.md`
   - Update the SOP manifest

6. **Explain integration** — Tell the user how this SOP will be applied:
   - Which commands will reference this SOP
   - Which workflow steps will be added to outputs
   - When human approval gates will be flagged

## Output

- Confirmation with SOP name and step count
- Preview of the structured SOP
- Explanation of which commands/modules will reference this SOP
- Suggestion: "This SOP will apply across all brands. To create brand-specific workflows, use guidelines instead."

## Examples

**User**: "Before publishing any content, it needs to go through: 1. Writer creates draft, 2. Editor reviews for quality, 3. Brand manager checks voice alignment, 4. Legal reviews if it contains claims, 5. Client approves, 6. Publish"

**Result**: Saves to `~/.claude-marketing/sops/content-approval.md`:
